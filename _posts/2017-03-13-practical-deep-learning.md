##### Micha's talk demystifies deep learning. [View the slides.](http://micha.codes/2017-qcon-deeplearning/#1)

Our research team spent last week in London hosting sessions and workshops about applied machine learning at the [QCon conference](https://qconlondon.com/london-2017/track/modern-learning-systems). Micha Gorelick gave a talk about building a working product with Keras, a high level deep learning framework. He started by explaining deep learning at a conceptual level (describing neural networks like universal approximation theorems to approximate arbitrary functions by iteratively tuning weights and biases on training data) and then showed the code and design decisions we used to train and deploy our model for [automated text summarization](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/04/11/new-tools-to-summarize-text.html). During this talk, he also situates Keras alongside other tools, like Tensorflow, MXNet and Theano, in the in the deep learning framework ecosystem.
