<p>We&rsquo;re very pleased to announce our second research report topic will be realtime stream analysis, with a focus on probabilistic data structures.Â </p>
<p>Using these techniques, we&rsquo;re able to build systems that enable extremely fast and memory efficient computation over very large data sets. For example, imagine being able to do comparisons between two sets of billions of items in milliseconds using only a few megabytes of memory.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re exploring applications with partners in marketing, healthcare, and science. If you have ideas for what you would do with these superpowers, get in touch!</p>
