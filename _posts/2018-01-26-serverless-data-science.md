Cloud computing has transformed enterprise IT. It makes it possible to rapidly
scale up and down a complex and global infrastructure, without the overhead of
a datacenter. But living in the cloud can be expensive, and you still need to
maintain computers and their operating systems, even if they are virtual.
That's why we've been watching with interest the rise of "serverless"
computing.

Serverless has the potential to open up "big data" work to mere mortal data
scientists who don't have the budget or engineering support for a
long-lived analytics cluster, and to make life simpler and reduce costs for
those that do.

Traditional cloud "elastic compute" systems (like Amazon's EC2, Google's Computer
Engine, or Azure's Virtual Machines) allow you to run applications without
maintaining hardware. The goal of "serverless" is to go even further, and make
it possible to run applications without worrying about hardware _or_ the
operating system.

Serverless environments (like Amazon's Lambda, Google's Cloud Functions, or Azure's
Functions) can be thought of as computing environments that pop into existence
for the duration of a single function call, and are then destroyed. Configuring
and maintaining the underlying operating system is somebody else's problem.

Because the serverless instance exists only for the duration of the function,
there's no idle time and your bill scales almost perfectly with the amount of
compute you use. Combined with the fact that you no longer need to configure and
maintain the operating system, this can result in big savings. For example,
our friends at Postlight converted their Readability application to run on AWS
Lambda and [reduced the monthly cost from over $10,000 to
$370](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/serving-39-million-requests-for-370-month-or-how-we-reduced-our-hosting-costs-by-two-orders-of-edc30a9a88cd).

But it's not all good news. Because the environment ends after the function
finishes, input and output must occur via a web API or a database connection.
There is no internal state or disk. And the various cloud providers place CPU,
RAM, time, and programming language constraints on what you can do. (For example,
AWS Lambda functions must run Python, C#, node.js or Java; R is not an option.
And the function must return in less than 300 seconds and use no more than
1.5Gb of RAM.)

These limitations might seem to make serverless less appealing to power-hungry
data scientists and data engineers - and indeed, so far most of the prominent
uses of serverless have been in web applications, where the computational
requirements are less intense. But in many ways the constraints of serverless
are similar to those faced in distributed analytics clusters running Hadoop or
Spark. To do data analytics in these environments, we have the map-reduce
computing paradigm, which parallelizes work by splitting it into small parcels.

##### PyWren's computational power can grow to many TFLOPS as the number of workers (inexpensive AWS Lambda instances in this case) increases. Image credit: [Occupy the Cloud: Distributed Computing for the 99%](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04024) 

[PyWren](http://pywren.io/) is a distributed analytics tool that connects the
dots. It splits up large analytics jobs into smaller parcels of work, and ships
them off to hundreds or even thousands of serverless AWS Lambda instances. This
makes PyWren (with AWS Lambda as a computational "backend") a light-weight
alternative to complex, expensive (and admittedly more robust) map-reduce
frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark. 

And - perhaps most intriguing for us at Cloudera Fast Forward Labs, given our
interest in machine learning - it's exciting to see serverless used to [speed up
hyperparamter
optimization](http://tothestars.io/blog/2016/10/19/serverless-ai), a relatively
simple (but computationally intensive) part of model building.
