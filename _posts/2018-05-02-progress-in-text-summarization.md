We published our report on text summarization in 2016. Since then, we've
enjoyed helping our clients make use of techniques such as topic modeling,
document embedding, and recurrent neural networks to deal with text that ranges
in scope from product reviews to insurance documents to call transcripts to news. 

Our goal when we do research is to address capabilities and technologies that
we expect to become production-ready in one to two years. That focus on
fast-moving areas means that new algorithmic ideas sometimes come along that
allow our clients to extend or improve upon the work in our reports. Prompted in
part by Yue Dong's March 2018 _[Survey on Neural Network-Based Summarization
Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04589)_, we thought we'd take some time to
describe the developments in text summarization since our report was published. 

Put simply: there's bad news and there's good news.

The bad news is that we still don't think _abstractive_ summarization is ready
for production prime time. _Extractive_ summarization involves selecting a few
passages from a document or corpus and stitching them together to form a
summary. As we discuss in our report, [this is a tough
problem](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/04/11/new-tools-to-summarize-text.html).
But _abstractive_ summarization is harder still. Not only must you identify the
salient ideas, but you must also generate new text that expresses those ideas
concisely.

There has been considerable progress along these lines. The current state of
the art is 2017's attention-based pointer networks, e.g. [work from Abigail See
and collaborators at Stanford and Google
Brain](http://www.abigailsee.com/2017/04/16/taming-rnns-for-better-summarization.html)
and [Salesforce Research's work lead by Romain
Paulus](https://einstein.ai/research/your-tldr-by-an-ai-a-deep-reinforced-model-for-abstractive-summarization).

However, those authors would concede what [Noah Weber and collaborators showed
last month](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07038): in practice, these abstractive
networks work by "mostly, if not entirely, copying over phrases, sentences, and
sometimes multiple consecutive sentences from an input paragraph, effectively
performing extractive summarization." So, for now at least, you get the training
data requirements and engineering complexity of cutting-edge deep learning
without the practical performance increase. Which is not to say academic work
on abstractive summarization is at a dead end; we look forward to reporting on the
inevitable breakthroughs in a year or two.

In the meantime, we promised good news!

The good news is a couple of really nice papers that make concrete improvements
to _extractive_ summarization. Both are from the same Edinburgh group. [Neural
Extractive Summarization with Side
Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04530) (2017) takes advantage of a very
natural heuristic that was used in classical summarization algorithms: titles
and image captions are particularly strong signals of the important ideas in a
document. This heuristic is incorporated into an attention-based
encoder-decoder network, and they get [really nice extractive
results](http://kinloch.inf.ed.ac.uk/sidenet.html). If your source documents
have that kind of structure, this approach is worth investigating. More
ambitiously, in [Ranking Sentences for Extractive Summarization with
Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08636) (2018) the same group
recasts extractive summarization as a reinforcement learning task. Unusually,
they learn to _rank_ sentences in the source document rather than score them in isolation, which they argue results in more coherent (and less verbose) overall
summaries.

So, two years after our report, text summarization remains not only a useful
business capability, but a very vibrant area of research.
