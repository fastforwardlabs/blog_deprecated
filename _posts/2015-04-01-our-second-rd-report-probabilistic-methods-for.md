Our second R&D Report, <i>Probabilistic Methods for Realtime Streams</i>, has gone out! In this report, we explored probabilistic algorithms for machine learning on potentially large realtime streams of data with efficient CPU and memory usage.

Our prototype demonstrated these algorithms running on large amounts of social conversation data. More on that soon.
