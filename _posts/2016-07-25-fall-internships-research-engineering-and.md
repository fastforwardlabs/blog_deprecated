## Research Engineering Intern

### Key Responsibilities

<p>You’ll read current computer science research papers and generally stay up on what’s interesting in the field (we focus on data and machine learning but have wide interests). You’ll then synthesize new solutions and algorithms in these areas, build prototype systems that demonstrate the feasibility of these approaches, and contribute your written perspective to our published reports. You’ll help bring our research to life by working on real-world data science problems for our clients and writing technical posts for our blog. Primarily, we want someone interested in making stuff, and who is up for learning whatever they need to learn to get those things made.<br/></p><p>This opportunity is open to current undergraduate and graduate students, as well as recent graduates and career changers seeking an internship position.<br/></p>

### Skills and Qualifications:

<p>We primarily work in Python for research and data analysis but are always open to the best technologies for a given problem.</p><p>We expect you to be a strong programmer, with a good background in math and statistics, and excellent communication skills. Prior experience with machine learning is a plus.</p>

## Prototype and Data Visualization Intern

### Key Responsibilities:

<p>You will help to conceive and build prototypes and data visualizations demonstrating the capabilities of Fast Forward Labs technology research projects. Each quarter we focus on a different near-future technology (past topics include image object recognition and natural language generation). To communicate the value of these technologies to our clients we make product-style prototypes, data visualizations, and reports with explanatory illustrations. You would help with the creation of those materials. By the end of the internship you will be responsible for creating your own demo on, or visualization of, an aspect of the technology we focus on for our next report. You will also be responsible for posting updates to our company blog about your work.</p><p>This opportunity is open to current undergraduate and graduate students, as well as recent graduates and career changers seeking an internship position.<br/></p>

### Skills and Qualifications

<p>Our ideal candidate is interested in both code and design. Familiarity with HTML and Javascript, which we use to code our prototypes and visualizations, is required. Experience in design and visualization is a big plus. If you’re a programmer looking to move more into design or a designer who has moved into programming this could be a great fit for you. Primarily, we want someone interested in making stuff, and who is up for learning whatever they need to learn to get those things made.</p>
