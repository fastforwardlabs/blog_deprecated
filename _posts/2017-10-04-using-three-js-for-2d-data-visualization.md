##### Update: I have a new post on [Using three.js for 2D data visualization](https://beta.observablehq.com/@grantcuster/using-three-js-for-2d-data-visualization). It contains all the stuff I learned while working on the project and is the place you should look for updated code. This post may still be interesting if you want to see my thoughts when I first started on the project.

We've started work on our next prototype. While the design is still
evolving, we're pretty sure one element of it will be a visualization of tens of
thousands of data points, clustered through a dimensional reduction algorithm
(most likely using
[T-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)).
For the past week I've been exploring how to render that many points in the
browser and I
wanted to document some early lessons in this post, specifically about using the
[three.js](https://threejs.org/) library.

I'm new to three.js so this isn't a best practices post. Hopefully this provides a
starting point for people interested in doing similar data visualization work.
If you have ideas on how to do this stuff better, I'd love to hear them via
Twitter ([@grantcuster](//www.twitter.com/GrantCuster)).

## What I'm after

##### The final result: [a T-SNE rendered in three.js with a map style pan and zoom](https://codepen.io/GrantCuster/pen/rGGRRp).

I want to render a visualization with tens of thousands of points. I want to be
able to zoom into that visualization by scrolling and pan by clicking and
dragging (think [Google Maps](//maps.google.com)). I want the zoom to follow the
position of the mouse and I want that zoom to feel smooth and responsive. I also want the browser to
not crash when I do those things.

## Challenges

The main challenge has been getting a good zoom feel. For me, zoom feels bad
when:

1. The framerate drops because the browser can't handle rendering that many points.
2. The zoom behavior is too fast, or jerky.

The solution to #1 is to use three.js. The solution to #2 (so far) is to use
[D3.js's zoom behavior](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom) combined with three.js.
More detail on both below.

## Rendering strategies

There are three strategies I considered for visualizing a bunch of
points on the web:

1. [D3.js rendering to SVG](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4e3925cdc804db257a86fdef3a032a45)
2. [D3.js rendering to canvas (better performance)](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/b418a040bb28295e4a78581fe8e269d1)
3. [Three.js rendering to canvas with webGL (best performance when rendering lots of points)](https://codepen.io/GrantCuster/pen/QqvXwd)

Most D3 examples use SVG, but there are canvas examples for when you are
animating lots of points and need the boosted performance. I didn't find any
three.js-specific examples so I made my own. I'd love to see an
exhaustive investigation and benchmark for the performance of each (and
alternative methods!), but I'm not going to do that here.

## Prior art and past experience

I'd had my own experience with the limits of SVG rendering for lots of points.
I'd also seen a bit of what WebGL could do while working on our [Probabilistic Real
Estate prototype](http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/pre), which uses [Mapbox's
WebGL library](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/). For knowledge of
canvas and three.js strategies, I was lucky to have the examples of two great
past projects from FFL interns. 

- [Aditya](//www.twitter.com/whaleandpetnuia) used D3 rendered to canvas in his
  [visualization of a community's taste in
movies](http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/cinephile_tsne/). I watched him push
canvas rendering to its limits, rendering around 20,000 points. 
- [Sepand](//sepans.com/) used three.js to render his [visualization
  of Wikipedia articles](//www.fastforwardlabs.com/encartopedia). He was able to
render 100,000 points without framerate issues. Coming (like me) from D3
experience, he had to invest considerable dev time in understanding
three.js's camera system.

Based on those experiences, I went into this project thinking I'd use three.js. It also just
seemed like fun. Three.js comes more out of the game dev world 
than the web app one I'm used to. A lot of recent web app
innovation has come from adopting techniques from the video game world, so I was
excited about the opportunity to further explore that path.

## Getting started in three.js

I looked through the three.js [documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/introduction/Creating-a-scene) and [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/). Then I started looking
for examples of 2D visualizations that were similar to what I wanted to create. There are
not many. I did find this [Stack Overflow post about setting up a 2D
view](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21786184/setting-up-a-2d-view-in-three-js),
which had some helpful points for getting started and an encouraging tone (I
love that by the third update they're reading [Computer Graphics and Principles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321399528/)).

### Setting the scene

I started with the basic scene set-up from the three.js
tutorial, and worked on replacing the spinning cube with a wall of points. I put
some work into trying to understand the [PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/cameras/PerspectiveCamera), but in terms of getting
things to render at the size I was after I mainly used trial and error of
plugging in different parameters. One of the downsides of rendering to a canvas
(rather than HTML or SVG) is that you don't have a DOM to inspect for debugging.
Often I'd find myself  with a blank canvas and I'd have to retrace my steps to a
point where things were working. I made frequent reference to [Sepand's
code](https://github.com/sepans/wikiviz).

### The animation loop

One of the video game techniques you use in three.js is the animation loop:


```javascript
// Three.js render loop
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

Rather than having logic set up to only re-draw when things change, the animation
loop is always re-drawing. Because of this, you don't have to worry about render
logic as you update objects (like the camera) in a three.js scene. You just
update them. This resonates with the philosophy of newer javascript frameworks like
[React](https://reactjs.org/). I don't know the exact paths of influence there (I would be interested to
read them!) but it's fun for me to discover connections as I go.

### Z-Fighting

![A screenshot of the flickering points debug demo.](//blog.fastforwardlabs.com/images/2017/10/z-fighting.png)

##### An early challenge: [flickering caused by z-fighting](https://codepen.io/GrantCuster/pen/GMmPxx)

After I got a lot of points to render at the size I wanted, I found that some of the
points would flicker. I eventually learned this flickering was caused by
[z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting), where, because they were
all on the same z-level, different points were 'winning' each time the scene was
drawn. It sounds like there is some combination of camera properties that could
solve the issue, but I was unable to find the right combo. As pointed out in the
[above-mentioned Stack Overflow
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21786184/setting-up-a-2d-view-in-three-js),
you may also be able to fix it by slightly varying the z-value of each point. If
it came to it I would do that, but it didn't feel right.

I ended up solving the problem by setting `sizeAttenuation: false` on the
[PointsMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/PointsMaterial). In its default state of `true`, `sizeAttenuation` scales the
points so they appear larger as you get closer and smaller as you move the camera
farther away. Attenuation makes sense as a simulation of real objects, but
for a visualization, setting it to `false`, which means the points stay the same
size regardless of zoom level, is often more desirable. Unattenuated means that as you zoom in, the negative space between points
expands. For dense visualizations, this lets you see local structure better as
you zoom in. I'm not sure why turning off `sizeAttenuation` fixed the z-fighting issue, but since I wanted it off anyway, I closed
the case.

## Zoom and pan

Getting the points on the screen went fairly smoothly. Dialing in a zoom and pan
set-up that I'm happy with was more of a process. Targeted
zoom requires an understanding of the camera and perspective that I'm still
developing.

### Handling mouse events

First I needed to translate mouse events into zoom and pan actions. I started by
trying to plug in [D3's zoom behavior](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom), since I was most familiar with it, and I
didn't want to do the low-level event work of calculating how far a user
scrolled. The zoom behavior gets you a scale level, and an `x` and `y` value.
Combined in a transform, they get you the sort of directed zoom I was after. But I ended up
using only the scale level from it because I could not figure out how to translate
the `x` and `y` coordinates into the correct three.js camera
position. I'm 90% sure it's doable, but I didn't figure it out this round.

### Directed zoom

I had a hard time finding an example of the zoom behavior I wanted implemented
in three.js. Even Google's impressive [Embedding
Projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org/) zooms to the center of the screen
rather than following the mouse position. I thought that if I could figure out
how to translate the mouse position on screen along different z-values,
I could figure something out myself. That question turns out to be a
relatively well-explored one because people often need it to calculate hover
interactions with objects.

This [code snippet from
WestLangley](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13055214/mouse-canvas-x-y-to-three-js-world-x-y-z/13091694#13091694) turned out to be the key for getting
directed zoom working:

```javascript
var vector = new THREE.Vector3();

vector.set(
    ( event.clientX / window.innerWidth ) * 2 - 1,
    - ( event.clientY / window.innerHeight ) * 2 + 1,
    0.5 );

vector.unproject( camera );

var dir = vector.sub( camera.position ).normalize();

var distance = - camera.position.z / dir.z;

var pos = camera.position.clone().add( dir.multiplyScalar( distance ) );
```

It projects a ray from the camera through the mouse position. You can then
move along that ray on the z-axis, using the `z` value to get back new `x` and
`y` coordinates. In [my code](https://codepen.io/GrantCuster/pen/rGGRRp), I'm taking the scale from D3's zoom behavior and
plugging it in as the new `z` value. I can then use the `x` and `y` values to set the
new camera position and get the directed zoom effect I was after. My
understanding of *exactly* what's happening here is still fuzzy, I tried
dissecting it a bit and hope to do more in the future. For now, though, it
works.

### Crashing

I crashed my browser a lot during the zoom experiments, and sometimes even crashed my
computer especially when I started trying to `console.log` to debug on zoom
events. I don't have any real insight into what was causing the crash. I tried
some developer tools profiling, but I wasn't really sure what to look for. Compared
to an error message, a crash is a real bummer to recover from, and it's a big
reason I didn't dissect the zoom code further. The cost of a mistake was too
high. This was compounded because I don't really have a sense yet of what is
expensive for three.js/3D in general and what is not. I kept stumbling into
crashes while changing something I thought was innocuous. The whole experience made me less
likely to experiment with changing things that were working, which is a big part
of how I learn how things work. I don't know if there's anything to be done at a
library or browser level that would result in more error messages and fewer
crashes, but it would be a big help for getting started.

### Panning

While looking for a panning solution, I found [Andrei Kashcha's
three.map.control](https://github.com/anvaka/three.map.control),
which conceptually had the things I was after for both directed zoom and
panning. I did not like the zoom feel, however. In my opinion it moves 
too fast and the thresholding makes it jerky. The momentum setting on the
panning is also not what I was after.
 
I checked out the code, and found the `getCurrentScale`
function which calculates the current scale based on the camera settings and `z`
value. Using this along with the `movementX` and `movementY` events from D3's
zoom behavior (how
far you'd dragged) yielded the pan behavior I was after.

I experimented with using `getCurrentScale` to replace the ray function I was using for zoom.
It seemed cleaner to have the directed zoom and panning operating off the same
logic. After a fair amount of experimenting I got values fairly close to the ray
method – but not close enough. It felt like I was zooming on ice.  I'm
still 90% sure can be done, but after crashing the browser a bunch
of times trying to figure it out, I decided to stick with the current working
configuration.

## A practical success

So, after lots of experimentation, crashes, and help from other people's code, 
I made it to [a working example with tens of thousands of
points, and the zoom and panning behavior I was
after](https://codepen.io/GrantCuster/pen/rGGRRp). I'd like to tighten up the
code for that behavior as well as my understanding of it, but that's 
always the case. I've had my first tangle with a lot of the concepts and edges
of three.js, and I expect I'll have lots of opportunities to revisit them. I look 
forward to learning how to do all of this stuff better in the future.

## Notes
- In the current demo the zoom direction is inverted because I'm plugging D3's
  scale directly into the camera's z-value. D3 evidently has some easing as you
zoom in close, where it slows down the rate of zoom change. That means I can't
just simply invert the scale. I'll figure out something to fix this in the
future.
- In the demo, I scale the point size up a bit when you're really close. This is
  what feels best to me -- points stay the same size most of the way in, but at
the end they get a bit bigger. Right now it's all an experiment in what feels right.
- Why exactly is three.js fast? This is something I'd love to learn more about.
  My operating understanding is that WebGL uses the GPU, which is good at doing
these kinds of calculations, and three.js is also very smart about only drawing
what you can currently see (known as culling). I don't know how this all plays
out though. Is it fast mostly because of the GPU use or mostly because of the
culling?
- The camera uses a field of view setting which is not at all intuitive to me, but if you
  have friends or coworkers who are into actual physical cameras they'll have a
bunch of experience with it. You can ask them about it and they'll probably draw
diagrams.
- Why am I using a 3D library for a 2D visualization? Because it's fast. I did
  look at the 2D WebGL renderer [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/) but found mostly
game related examples. I could also try using the WebGL library directly. I'd
love to read about either of those approaches. But given my time limit three.js
seemed the right level at which to dive in.
- Why are the points squares? It is apparently more taxing to draw circles.
  Sepand did it, and I plan to eventually (with sprites) once I understand the
ins-and-outs a little more.
