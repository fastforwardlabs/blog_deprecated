Join us <b>April 28 in New York City</b> as we discuss how to build strong data teams in complex organizations. You can <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ffl-data-leadership-conference-tickets-22590364388">register here</a>. </p><p>In a recent <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3048419/big-data/data-scientist-hilary-mason-wants-to-show-you-the-near-future.html">Computerworld article</a>, our CEO &amp; Founder Hilary Mason explained common pitfalls organizations face when trying to build a data-driven organization: they over-invest in technical architecture, hire the wrong people, or lack the leadership focus required to cut across political silos, and foster innovation and change. </p><p>At this half-day event, you&rsquo;ll see how organizations across several industries successfully hire, structure teams, prioritize projects, operationalize results, and drive excellence for their data capabilities. You&rsquo;ll also have a chance to network with data leaders from a rich variety of backgrounds and industries. </p><p>The event will feature insights from recognized leaders in the field, including a keynote on building a data culture (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtunkelang">Daniel Tunkelang</a>), a panel featuring perspectives from Booz Allen Hamilton, Mashable, and Dstillery, an overview of our research at Fast Forward Labs, and introductions to our favorite machine intelligence startups. </p><p>We’re grateful to Booz Allen Hamilton, our partner in producing this event. Make sure to check out the great work they’re doing in the <a href="http://www.datasciencebowl.com/">Data Science Bowl</a>! </p><p>We look forward to seeing you April 28!</p>
