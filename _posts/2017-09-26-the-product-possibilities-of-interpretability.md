##### This post is part of a series highlighting the importance of interpretability. Previous posts include a [video conversation on interpretability](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/09/11/interpretability-webinar.html), [a guide to using the LIME technique to predict whether couples will stay together](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/09/01/LIME-for-couples.html), and a look at the [business rationale](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/08/02/business-interpretability.html). In [our post on FairML](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/03/09/fairml-auditing-black-box-predictive-models.html), we used interpretability techniques to identify discriminatory bias in algorithms.

As the use of machine learning algorithms increases, the need to understand
them grows as well. This is true at both a societal and a product level. As
algorithms enter into our workplaces and workflows, they can appear mysterious and
intimidating. Their predictions may be precise, but the utility of those
predictions is limited if we cannot understand how they were reached. Without
interpretability, even accurate algorithms are poor team players—technically
correct but uncommunicative.

Interpretability opens up opportunities for collaboration with algorithms.
During their development, it promises better processes for feature engineering
and model debugging. After completion, it can enhance users' understanding of
the system being modeled and advise on what actions to take.

##### The Refractor prototype shows how different attributes affect a customer's likelihood to churn.

For our prototype, we wanted to explore how that collaboration through
interpretability might look. We chose an area, churn probability for customers
of an internet service provider, where the collaboration payoff is high. The base of the prototype is a supervised machine learning model of customer churn (how likely a customer is to unsubscribe) trained on public data. Making
the churn prediction is the kind of problem machine learning excels at, but
without an understanding of what features are driving the predictions, user
trust and ability to take action based on the model are limited. With
interpretability, we can break out of those limitations.

Our prototype, Refractor, explores how interpretability can be visualized. It guides the user through two levels of interpretability, from a
global table view of customers to an exploration of the effects of different
features on an individual user. The process of building the prototype was also
a movement between, and eventually a balancing of, those two levels.

## Global View: Understanding the Model

Refractor uses [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) to explore which features are most affecting
the model's prediction. LIME is focused on local explanation of feature importance through feature
perturbation. It may initially seem a strange choice, then, to use it in a
globally oriented view. The stacked local interpretations, however, coalesce
into a powerful global representation of how the algorithm works. For many
complex algorithms, this is the only kind of global view you can have.

<div class="html-video-holder"><video controls="true" autoplay="true" loop="true" src="/images/2017/09/refractor-global.mp4"></video></div>

##### The global table displays the churn probability prediction (calculated by the model) and highlights in red and blue the importance of different features in making that prediction (as calculated by LIME). Columns can be sorted by value to explore the relationships across customers.

Machine learning models are powerful because of their ability to capture
nonlinear relationships. Nonlinear relationships cannot be reduced to global
feature importance without significant information loss. By highlighting local
feature importance within a table view, you do see important columns begin to
emerge, but you can also observe patterns, like discontinuities in a feature's
importance, that would have to be averaged out if feature importance was
globally calculated.

The table, as a sort of global view of local interpretability, highlights how
interpretability depends on collaboration. The intuitive feel a user builds up
from scrolling through the highlighted features depends on our ability to
recognize patterns and develop models in our heads that explain those
patterns, a process that mirrors some of the work the computer model is doing.
In a loose sense, you can imagine that the highlighted features give you a
glimpse of how the model sees the data—model vision goggles. This view can
help us better debug, trust, and work with our models. It is important to keep
perspective, however, and remember that the highlighted features are an
abstracted _representation_ of how the model works, not how it _actually_
works. After all, if we could think at the scale and in the way the model
does, we wouldn't need the model in the first place.

## Local View: Understanding the Customer

While the table view is a powerful interface, it can feel overwhelming. For
this prototype, we wanted to complement it with an individual customer view
that would focus on actions you could take in relation to a specific customer.

<div class="html-video-holder"><video controls="true" autoplay="true" loop="true" src="/images/2017/09/refractor-customer.mp4"></video></div>

##### The individual customer view shifts the focus from comparisons across customers to one particular customer.

Free of the table, we are now able to change the displayed feature order. The
obvious move is to sort the features by their relative importance to the
prediction. In the vertical orientation, this creates a list of the factors
most strongly contributing to the customer's likelihood of churning. For a
customer service representative looking for ways to decrease the chance the
customer will leave, this list can function as a checklist of things to try to
change.

<div class="html-video-holder"><video controls="true" autoplay="true" loop="true" src="/images/2017/09/refractor-sort.mp4"></video></div>

##### Using LIME, we can sort customer attributes by their relative importance to the churn prediction.

Because this sorting is an obvious move, it's easy to undervalue its
usefulness. It is worth remembering that without LIME (or a different
interpretability strategy), the list would remain unsorted. You could manually
alter features to see how the probability changed, but it would be a long and tedious process.

The implicit recommendations of the feature checklist are built upon with
further information. The recommendation side panel highlights the top three
and uses the model to calculate the percent reduction in
churn probability that changing each feature would have.

<div class="html-video-holder"><video controls="true" autoplay="true" loop="true" src="/images/2017/09/refractor-recommendations.mp4"></video></div>

##### The recommendation sidebar highlights the top possible churn reduction actions.

As the user follows these recommendations, or explores by changing other
feature values for the individual customer, we not only calculate the new churn
prediction, we also calculate the weights based on the new feature set. This
ability to change one feature value and see the ripple effect on the importance
of other features once again helps the user build up an intuitive feeling of
how the model works. In the case of a customer service representative with an
accurate model, that intuitive understanding translates to an ability to act
off of its insights.

## Product Tension: Focus vs. Context

As we developed the global and local interfaces of the prototype, we constantly
engaged with a tension between providing the user with context and providing a
focused and directed experience. This tension will arise any time you are
adding interpretability to a model, and requires careful consideration and
thought about the purpose of your product.

In the early stages of prototype development we kept all of the features
visible, using color and ordering to emphasize those with higher importances.
As we probed how a consumer product using LIME might work, we explored only
showing the highest-importance features for each customer. After all, if you're
a customer service representative concerned with convincing a user to stay, why
would you need to know about features that, according to the model, have no
discernible effect on the churn prediction?

##### Early interface experiments displayed only the top three features for each customer. The view was focused but provided the user with less context to understand the model. 

We experimented with interfaces emphasizing just the top features, and they did
have the benefit of being more clear and focused. However, the loss of context
ended up decreasing the user's trust and understanding of the model. The model
went back to feeling more black box-like. Being able to see which factors don't
make contributions to the prediction (for example, gender) and checking those
against your own intuitions is key to trusting the features that are rated of
high importance.

Having seen the importance of context, we decided to focus our prototype on
that, while also dedicating some space to a more focused experience. In the
individual view, this means that along with the full list of features we show the more targeted recommendation panel. For a customer service representative, this recommendation panel could be the primary view, but
providing it alongside the full feature list helps the user feel like they're
on stable ground. The context provides the background for users to take more
focused action.

## Collaborating with Algorithms

Trust is a key component of any collaboration. As algorithms become
increasingly prevalent in our lives the need for trust and collaboration will
grow. Interpretability strategies like LIME open up new possibilities for that
collaboration, and for better and more responsible use of algorithms. As those
techniques develop they will need to be supported by interfaces that balance
the need for context with a focus on possible actions.
