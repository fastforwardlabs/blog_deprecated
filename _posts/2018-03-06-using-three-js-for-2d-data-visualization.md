A code walkthrough of how to use three.js for large 2D data visualizations. Three.js can smoothly render a large number of points in the browser but there are some tricks to making it work for interactive 2D visualizations. This is the guide that I wish I would have had when I built our most recent prototype. It shows how to enable mouse-directed and zoom and point hover interactions. It is presented as an interactive javascript notebook with working code.
