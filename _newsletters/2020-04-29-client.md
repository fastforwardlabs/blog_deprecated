## NLP for Question Answering

*by [Melanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanierbeck/) and [Ryan](https://twitter.com/MicallefEsq)*

Typically, our applied research on a particular topic culminates in a quarterly report,  along with a live webinar demonstrating the prototypes we build in conjunction with that research. Our next research report on *Causality for Machine Learning* will be released in that same format at the end of May.  But for the following report, which will focus on *NLP for Question Answering*, we thought it would be fun to invite you to join us <em>while we build</em>.

Learn more in our launch post [here], and join us at [qa.fastforwardlabs.com](qa.fastforwardlabs.com) as we explore this exciting topic.

## Causality for Machine Learning

Join Cloudera Fast Forward research engineers [Chris Wallace](https://twitter.com/_cjwallace) and [Nisha Muktewar](https://twitter.com/NishaMuktewar) on May 28th at 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET for a webinar on *[Causality for Machine Learning](https://www.cloudera.com/about/events/webinars/causality-for-machine-learning.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter-FastForwardLabs&keyplay=ODL&utm_campaign=FY21-Q2_CW_AMER_Causality_for_ML_2020-05-28&cid=7012H000001OmCQ)*. During the webinar, they'll discuss how combining causal inference with machine learning can help us address these problems. They'll cover:

* when you should think about causality and lessons to apply in  your data science practice,
* the latest research at the intersection of machine learning and causality, and
* how causal thinking helps us write models that generalize to new circumstances, including an example of the causal approach applied to a computer vision problem,
* and the ethical implications of causality.  

We look forward to seeing you there! You can register [here](https://www.cloudera.com/about/events/webinars/causality-for-machine-learning.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter-FastForwardLabs&keyplay=ODL&utm_campaign=FY21-Q2_CW_AMER_Causality_for_ML_2020-05-28&cid=7012H000001OmCQ).
