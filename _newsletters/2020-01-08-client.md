## Introducing Anomagram — An Interactive Visualization of Autoencoders, Built with Tensorflow.js

_by [Victor](https://victordibia.github.io/anomagram/)_

Across many business use cases that generate data, it is frequently desirable to automatically identify data samples that deviate from “normal.” In many cases, these deviations are indicative of issues that need to be addressed. For example, an abnormally high cash withdrawal from a previously unseen location may be indicative of fraud. An abnormally high CPU temperature may be indicative of impending hardware failure. 

The task of finding these anomalies is broadly referred to as Anomaly Detection, and many excellent approaches have been proposed (clustering-based approaches, 
nearest neighbors, density estimation, etc.). However, as data become high dimensional, with complex patterns, existing approaches (linear models which mostly focus on univariate data) can be unwieldy to apply. For such problems, deep learning can help.

In [a recent post on Medium](https://medium.com/@victor.dibia/anomagram-433d00db7261), I introduced [Anomagram](https://victordibia.github.io/anomagram/#/), an interactive visualization of how autoencoders can be applied to the task of anomaly detection. Anomagram is created as both a learning tool, and a prototype example of what an ML product interface could look like. The interface is built with Tensorflow.js and allows install-free experimentation in the browser. 

The first part of the interface introduces important concepts (autoencoders, data transformations, thresholds, etc.) paired with appropriate interactive visualizations. The second part (pictured below) is geared towards more technical users and allows you to design, train, and evaluate an autoencoder model entirely in the browser.

##### **Train a Model Module**: Anomagram provides a direct manipulation interface that allows the user to specify a model (add/remove layers and units within layers), modify model parameters (training steps, batchsize, learning rate, regularizer, optimizer, etc), modify training/test data parameters (data size, data composition), train the model, and evaluate model performance (visualization of accuracy, precision, recall, false positive, false negative, ROC, etc. metrics) as each parameter is changed. The task is anomaly detection within ECG signal data.

If you're interested in learning more about other deep learning approaches to anomaly detection, my colleagues and I will cover additional details on this topic in our upcoming report on Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection. We'll keep you posted on the release date and webinar registration in future editions of this newsletter.
