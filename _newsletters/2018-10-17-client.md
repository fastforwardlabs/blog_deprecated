## The quest continues: A look at a new initiative to explore human and machine intelligence

_by [Alice](https://twitter.com/AliceAlbrecht)_

The resurrection of neural networks as a technique has helped propel the field of machine learning to the forefront of commercial applications. Today’s most popular applications focus on finding patterns in data and exploiting those patterns for very narrow tasks. But what if we want more from machine learning? Instead of trying to contort the methods we have today to achieve marginal gains in generalizability, what if we took another angle altogether?

Earlier this year, MIT launched [MIT Intelligence Quest](https://quest.mit.edu/), a large multidisciplinary group of researchers and engineers with two branches, “The Core” and “The Bridge.” The Core seeks to advance our understanding of intelligence in both humans and machines (and hopes the work from each area can inform the other). The Bridge provides a clear path toward applicability for industry and other academic labs inside and outside of MIT’s campus. The research community involved in MIT Quest does not just develop new algorithms or build tools to implement those algorithms; the group also researches the social, cultural, and ethical implications of AI research.

Some projects already coming out of The Quest are “moonshot” ideas that have the potential to really change the world. One such “moonshot” is led by work coming out of [Josh Tenenbaum's lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00289), which hopes to build models that exhibit infant-like capabilities to learn, using things like “intuitive physics” and “intuitive psychology.” These models are built using bayesian programs that utilize one-shot learning before generalizing. Tenenbaum’s moonshot project is just one of many that are being worked on as part of The Quest.

We're excited to see where this research leads and are pleased to see the announcement this week that MIT received an unprecedented $1 billion to create the [Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-reshapes-itself-stephen-schwarzman-college-of-computing-1015). This new college will likely help fund many more AI moonshot projects to come!

## FFL Is Reading

Here are a few articles we enjoyed reading this week:

* [A Taco Truck On Every Corner... or Not?](https://a2civic.tech/blog/2018/09/30/a-taco-truck-on-every-corner-or-not) - a fun application of postgres and GIS to answer the question: where is it legal to locate a taco truck in Ann Arbor, Michigan?
* [Federated Learning for Firefox](https://florian.github.io/federated-learning-firefox/) - federated learning (distributed learning that preserves privacy and minimizes communication costs) is the subject of our next report. There's lots of academic research, but this is the first article that goes into any technical depth about its production use.
* [Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00289) - this article comes out of Josh Tenenbaum's lab (referenced above) and looks at how we can think of machine learning in terms of "model building" which uses models for understanding the world (based on human development) instead of focusing on pattern recognition.
* [5 Ways Your Data Strategy Can Fail](https://hbr.org/2018/10/5-ways-your-data-strategy-can-fail) - a nice listicle. That photo, tho...
