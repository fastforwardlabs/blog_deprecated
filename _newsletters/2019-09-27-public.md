## Automating Weak Supervision
*by [Shioulin](https://twitter.com/shioulin_sam)*

### What is weak supervision?

We recently explored Snorkel, a weak supervision framework for learning when
there are limited high-quality labels (see [blog
post](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/07/08/snorkel_final.html) and
[notebook](https://experiments.fastforwardlabs.com/)). To use Snorkel, subject
matter experts first write labeling functions to programmatically create
labels. Very often these labeling functions attempt to capture heuristics. The
labels are then fed into a generative model. The job of the generative model is
to estimate the accuracy of the labeling functions while automatically taking
into account the pairwise correlation between these functions and labeling
propensity (how often a function actually creates a label). Once the generative
model is trained, it can be used to estimate the true label for each
candidate. The generative model outputs probabilistic labels - numbers between 0
and 1, representing the probability of a positive class. These probabilistic
labels can be used to train any end model with a _noise-aware_ loss.

Writing these labeling functions is sometimes not straight-forward; it can be
time consuming and expensive. The idea behind
Snuba ([PDF](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p223-varma.pdf)) is to create a system
to "automatically generate heuristics using a small labeled dataset to assign
training labels to a large unlabeled dataset." The labels generated by all these
heuristics then feed into a weak supervision framework.

### Automatically generating heuristics

Doing this step automatically requires replacing human reasoning that drives
heuristic development. The authors take their cue from how humans generate heuristics
in order to automate this process. From their observations, subject matter
experts often fiddle with the correct threshold for each heuristic in order to
make a correct classification. Radiologists, for example, try to figure out a
threshold for each heuristic that uses a geometric property of a tumor in order
to determine if it is malignant. In addition, subject matter experts tend to
develop a single heuristic to assign accurate labels to a _subset_ of the
unlabeled data; covering the entire set of unlabeled data requires multiple
heuristics. Lastly, humans stop generating heuristics when they have exhausted
their domain knowledge.

### Inner workings of Snuba

The proposed system works as follows, and requires a small set of labeled data
to begin. The labeled data is first transformed into primitives (or
features). For tumor images, this might mean numerical features such as area of
perimeter of tumor. For text data, this might be one-hot vectors for the bag of
words representation. Once we have the primitives, Snuba iteratively generates
hueristics on a subset of the input data. Each iteration results in a new
heuristic specialized to the subset of data that did not receive high confidence
labels from the existing set of heuristics. In addition, the system knows when
to stop. All these are accomplished using a three part architecture: synthesizer, pruner, and verifier.

#### Synthesizer

"The synthesizer takes as input the labeled dataset, or a subset of the labeled
dataset after the first iteration, and outputs a _candidate_ set of
heuristics." Each heuristic is actually a classification model - a decision
stump, a logistic regressor, or a k_nearest neighbor classifier. These models
take in primitives (feature representation of the original datapoint) and assign
probabilistic labels to the data points. For binary classification,
these are probabilities that the input primitive is a 1 (positive label) or a
-1 (negative label).

![Models for creating heuristics ([image credit](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p223-varma.pdf))]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2019/09/Screen_Shot_2019_09_13_at_10_36_26_AM-1568385551725.png)

These probabilistic labels need to be turned into an actual label (since that's
what a human tries to do with heuristics). A straightforward approach to use
probability = 0.5 as a threshold. Any probability less than 0.5 is considered a
negative label, any probability above 0.5 is considered a positive label. Snuba
builds in a threshold _beta_ around 0.5, so anything greater than 0.5 + _beta_
is a positive label, and anything less than 0.5 - _beta_ is a negative
label. All other values result in an "abstained" label. The system tries to find
the _beta_ that maximizes the F1 score on the _labeled_ dataset. It does so by
iterating through equally spaced values in _beta_ (between 0 and 0.5),
calculating the F1 score the heuristic achieves, and selecting _beta_ that
maximizes the F1 score. In doing so, Snuba is using the heuristic performance on
the small labeled dataset as a proxy for the heuristic performance on the large
unlabeled data set.

#### Pruner

The pruner takes multiple candidate heuristics from the synthesizer and selects
one to add to the existing set of heuristics. The goal is to select heuristics
that label data points which have never received a label from other
heuristics. At the same time, the selected heuristics should perform well when
applied to the labeled dataset. To do this, the pruner uses a weighted average of
Jaccard distance and F1 score to select the highest ranking heuristic from the
candidate set.

#### Verifier

The verifier takes care of the stopping condition. It uses the label aggregator
(the generative model) to produce a single, probabilistic training label for each
datapoint in the unlabeled dataset. It also identifies data points in the labeled
dataset that receive low confidence labels (probability being close to 0.5). The
verifier passes this subset to the synthesizer with the assumption that similar
data . points in the unlabeled dataset would have also received low confidence
labels. The stopping condition is met "if i) a statistical measure suggests the
generative model in the synthesizer is not learning the accuracies of the
heuristics properly, or ii) there are no low confidence data points in the small,
labeled dataset." The statistical measure uses the small, labeled dataset to
indirectly determine whether the generated heuristics are worse than random for
the unlabeled dataset.

### Does it work?

The authors show that training labels from Snuba outperform labels from
semi-supervised learning and from user-developed heuristics in terms of end
model performance for tasks across various domains. These tasks include image
classification and text and multi-modal classification.

In some ways Snuba reminds us of active learning - the iterative nature, the
need for a stopping condition and the labeled dataset requirement. Active
learning relies on the initial small labeled dataset to build a learner (or a
model). A selection strategy then picks out data points that are difficult for the
model and requests labels for them. The labeled data points (labeled by humans)
are added back to the small labeled dataset and the process repeats. The learner
gets better as a result. Snuba relies on the initial small labeled dataset to
create some heuristics, and continues to use the same small labeled dataset to
add more heuristics while evaluating diversity using the unlabeled dataset. Both
need a stopping condition and Snuba's stopping condition is better defined. We
think Snuba seems promising, but wonder about the effect of generalizing from a
small, labeled dataset to a large, unlabeled dataset.

## Other Orders: Re-contextualizing the Familiar

*by [Grant](https://twitter.com/grantcuster)*

![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/editor_uploads/2019-09-18-153437-Screen_Shot_2019_09_06_at_3_12_08_PM.png)

##### My Twitter feed sorted by semantic similarity to "crudely understood Marxism" using [Other Orders](https://otherorders.net/).

To illustrate how categories shape our thoughts, [the philosopher Michel Foucault cites Jorge Luis Borges' (made-up) quotation from a "certain Chinese encyclopedia,"](http://individual.utoronto.ca/bmclean/hermeneutics/foucault_suppl/OT_Borges.htm) where it is supposedly written that:

> *Animals are divided into: (a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) suckling pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies.*

I thought of the Borges quote while reading through the list of Tweet sorting mechanisms in ["Other Orders" - a project by Sam Lavigne](https://otherorders.net/):

> *Alphabetical; Alphabetical by Username; Antisemitism as It Is Understood by the Right; Apocalyptic; Approximate Quantity of Shame Expressed; Chronological; Cop-Like; Crudely Understood Marxism; Density of Adjectives; Density of Nouns; Density of People, Places, Brands, Monetary Values and Dates; Density of Verbs; Eroticism as an Approximation of Similarity to a Phrase by Ana√Øs Nin; Exclamatory; Gothness; Kafkaesque-ness; Length of Text; Neoliberalism as Determined by Proximity to Famous Neoliberals; Number of Numbers; Percentage of Words Which Are Filler Words; Quantity of Gendered Words; Questioning; Similarity to @dril; Similarity to Values Expressed in TED Talks; Total All-Time Posts from User; Total Emoji; Total Favorites; Total Hashtags; Total Retweets; Use of Language Similar to Language Used by Corporate Social Media Accounts Such as Amazon.*

Both projects use alternate orders to make us think more critically about the ones we take for granted (the defaults). Lavigne wants to push back against recommendation systems that privilege engagement (views, likes, retweets, replies). Such systems can end up promoting content based on how controversial it is, regardless of its accuracy. Even the reverse-chronological sort, a default that feels 'natural' for our social media feeds, is a specific ordering choice with consequences. It means newness is privileged, and discourages making connections between Tweets across time. 

### On sorting

We sort by what is quantifiable. Engagement and chronology can be determined and sorted through metadata that is already numbers (add together views, likes and retweets for engagement; compare time for chronology). Part of the fun of the Other Orders list is how it moves between easily countable metadata, more advanced counting of types of words (nouns, verbs, numbers, emoji, filler words) and word similarity as calculated through word embeddings. It reminds me of building our prototypes, where you explore the options a new technology can open: *"Ok, we can identify nouns; let's see what it looks like if we sort by density of nouns... hmmm.... Ok, interesting. What else can we do?"*

##### Sorting by "similarity to the values expressed in TED talks" got me a top tweet of "[sparkle emoji] machine learning [sparkle emoji]".

My favorite categories are the "similarity" ones, including: *Similarity to Values Expressed in TED Talks*, *Similarity to [@dril](https://twitter.com/dril)*, and *Kafkaesque-ness*.  All of these categories involve looking at similarity between the tweets and an example text using word embeddings. Each of these categories contains a recognizable style. One drawn from literature (Kafka), one from weird Twitter ([@dril](https://twitter.com/dril)), and one from a particular genre of speaking (TED talks). 

### On the loss of context and making connections

One of the difficulties of fitting techniques like word embeddings into a product is the model's lack of a sense of context. It can get you a similar sentence, but it may pluck that sentence out of a paragraph on a different topic. This makes using it for things like summarization a difficult (but not insurmountable) challenge (see our summarization prototype [Brief](http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/brief/)). The cleverness of the similarity groupings in Other Orders is that they turn this lack of context to their advantage, sorting Tweets in a way that enables you to spot connections between people and topics that you would not otherwise have recognized. Looking at the top Kafka and @dril-like Tweets in my feed reminds me of looking at the [rabbit-duck illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit%E2%80%93duck_illusion): shift my head one direction and I can read the Tweet like a non-sequitur from @dril, shift it the other and I can figure out that in its original context it was a fragment from a larger thread. 

Just knowing that Tweets could be sorted in these ways shifts my experience of regular Twitter. Having been exposed to the lens of *"is this Tweet @dril-like?"*, I can start spotting @dril-like Tweets on my own. The @dril stuff is mostly for fun, but I can also see these alternate categories having a more substantial effect on how I understand my feed. Sorting by "Crudely Understood Marxism" ("Items are ordered relative to their semantic similarity to the phrase 'workers must seize the means of production.'") in my feed shows mostly web developers, writers, and game developers (the main groups I follow) talking about structural frustrations with their work. I read and understood these Tweets before, but since seeing the pattern exposed through the ordering, I now recognize them as part of a larger thread. *"Oh, there's another Tweet about burnout or the need to unionize,"* I now think to myself, connecting it to that new category in my head.

### Try it out

I recommend trying [Other Orders](https://otherorders.net/) for yourself. If you don't have Twitter or don't want to connect yours, play with sorting the sentences of works of literature on the about page; it will give you a good feel for how these sorting mechanisms can re-contextualize the familiar.

## Theories of (machine) learning should shape horizon scanning - not just application
*by [Ade](https://twitter.com/Adewunmi)*

In [a recent newsletter](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/08/28/is-machine-learning-research-moving-in-the-right-direction.html), Alice mused about how evolving views and theories of learning are shaping machine learning research and practice. If you‚Äôre an enterprise data scientist you‚Äôre very much focused on the practice of machine learning. Limited awareness of what‚Äôs shaping the machine learning breakthroughs that you‚Äôre trying to apply to real-life problems makes it easy to get locked into certain approaches and to inherit blind spots. The value of this type of epistemological insight to data science practitioners is obvious, but why should business leaders care about it, too? 

One good reason is that it makes for more discerning consumption of news about machine learning developments, and this, in turn, sharpens business leaders‚Äô horizon scanning capability. It‚Äôs useful to know that there isn‚Äôt wholesale consensus on the most fruitful path to advancing machine learning. The whole point of horizon scanning is to work out the best way to help your organization prepare and benefit from the broader trends, whether they are driven by technology, government policy or shifting consumer tastes. This, in turn, directly shapes the level and pace of your investment in your applied machine learning environment - specifically: talent, infrastructure, and governance. It should also guide your decisions about when and how to go about integrating machine learning into your business operations.
###  Digging into what are tech companies are doing as well as thinking

Several of the thought leaders referenced [in Alice‚Äôs article](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/08/28/is-machine-learning-research-moving-in-the-right-direction.html) are based in large tech companies. These organizations are increasingly sources of cutting edge machine learning research. And while the scale of industry-driven research has raised some [valid concerns](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612434/one-of-the-fathers-of-ai-is-worried-about-its-future/), there are some very real benefits to businesses:

* First, industry-driven research affords business leaders the opportunity to make informed bets about the broad viability of a particular approach to machine learning (beyond the soundness of the technology) before deciding to invest heavily themselves. For example, given Google‚Äôs and Facebook‚Äôs heavy investments in deep learning, it‚Äôs reasonable to bet on the emergence of a number of open source data science tools to facilitate this approach. This matters because access to these types of tools is critical for impactful and cost-effective data science practice within enterprises - and building them is [notoriously hard](https://medium.com/thelaunchpad/your-deep-learning-tools-for-enterprises-startup-will-fail-94fb70683834) to do. The availability of a broad range of open source tools (and libraries) maintained and supported by an enthusiastic and committed community is an important point of consideration when thinking about how to reliably and affordably build out your machine learning infrastructure planning. This is true even if you are swayed by the views of people such as Gary Marcus, who has [expressed skepticism](https://medium.com/@GaryMarcus/in-defense-of-skepticism-about-deep-learning-6e8bfd5ae0f1) about deep learning as the sole path towards artificial general intelligence, and instead advocates a hybrid approach that incorporates not just supervised forms of deep learning, but also techniques such as symbol-manipulation and (a re-conceptualized form of) unsupervised learning. 

* Second, the publicly accessible accounts of how these tech companies are implementing the fruit of their research provides a window into the practical challenges of trying to integrate machine learning into more and more of their day-to-day business operations, and doing so at scale. From a horizon scanning perspective, this is a rich source for useful insights into what could go wrong and what appears to work well. Further, because some of these organizations publish both accounts of their research and also of their (business) implementation efforts, you can read others‚Äô assessments of both of these things. These external reviews/commentary lack the rigor of academic peer reviews, but they do provide useful alternative perspectives for business leaders looking to assess the merits or demerits of a particular approach to applied machine learning. Take for example, Gary Marcus‚Äôs view of DeepMind‚Äôs framing of its systems as capable of ‚Äúautonomously learn[ing] how to model other agents in its world‚Äù as misleading. In a [blog post](https://medium.com/@GaryMarcus/deepminds-misleading-campaign-against-innateness-a2ea6eb4d0ba) on DeepMind‚Äôs [Machine Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07740) paper, he remarks, ‚Äúin fact, in close parallel with the Go work, DeepMind has quietly built in a wealth of prior assumptions.‚Äù

You may disagree with his assessment of reinforcement learning - or may not be certain what to think about it - but if reinforcement learning is something your organization is considering, then his comments highlight implementation considerations that are worth discussing with your in-house technical team.

And, as noted above, that‚Äôs the whole point of horizon scanning - trying to predict the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and trying to work out how best to navigate them before they become a reality. Asking good questions that lead to good conversations - with both your ML practitioners and operation teams - is a good way of doing this. 

If you want to dedicate more time to understanding the current machine learning landscape, but aren‚Äôt sure where to start, I recommend Adrian Colyer‚Äôs summaries of the [Microsoft](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/07/08/software-engineering-for-machine-learning/), [Facebook](https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/12/17/applied-machine-learning-at-facebook-a-datacenter-infrastructure-perspective/) and [Google](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/06/05/data-validation-for-machine-learning/) papers on their implementation efforts as a good place to start. I think he‚Äôs done a good job of capturing the most interesting points in those papers, and he presents them in an accessible way.
