## Convolve all the things

While deep learning can be applied generally, much of the excitement around it has stemmed from significant breakthroughs in two main areas: computer vision and natural language processing. Practitioners have typically applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to spatial data (e.g. images) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to sequence data (e.g. text). However, a [recent research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01271.pdf) has shown that convolutional neural networks are not only capable of performing well on sequential data tasks, but they have inherent advantages over recurrent networks and may be a better default starting point.

CNNs were designed originally to take advantage of spatial structure in the input data; for example, a pixel in an image is strongly related to nearby pixels. Sequence data also exhibits a “spatial” structure of sorts, where a particular word is strongly related to surrounding words. The observation is not new, though, and CNNs have been successfully applied to tasks involving sequences for decades. These applications have traditionally been things like sentiment or topic classification, where the output has the freedom to inspect every element in the input sequence. Until fairly recently, CNNs were not popular choices for tasks which involve mapping an input sequence to an output sequence (e.g., time series forecasting).

Vanilla CNNs applied to sequence forecasting have two pitfalls - the output incorporates input from both the past and the future, and they struggle to “see” or “remember” events in the distant past. Luckily, there are solutions for these two shortcomings: _causal convolutions_ and _dilated convolutions_, respectively. A causal convolution adjusts the convolution kernel to only look at data in the past:

while dilated convolutions introduce gaps that allow the output to incorporate information from the distant past:

CNNs that have been modified for use in temporal domains are called temporal convolutional networks or TCNs. One of the main benefits of using TCNs for sequence modeling tasks is that the convolutions can be computed in parallel since the output at a given timestep does not need to wait for previous timesteps. This is in contrast to an RNN, where each prediction must wait for all previous predictions. One potential downside to TCNs is that they do not encode the history of the sequence in a single hidden state like RNNs do, but instead require the entire input sequence to generate predictions. 

The authors of the paper present results that show that simple TCNs can beat popular recurrent architectures at sequence modeling tasks that have traditionally only used recurrent networks. While it would be counter-productive to declare a winner, it may be time to question our assumptions and consider TCNs as a first-class citizen for sequence modeling. If you’ve had success with using convolutional networks for time series or sequence modeling, we’d love to hear more about it!

## Progress in text summarization

We published our report on text summarization in 2016. Since then, we've
enjoyed helping our clients make use of techniques such as topic modeling,
document embedding, and recurrent neural networks to deal with text that ranges
in scope from product reviews to insurance documents to call transcripts to news. 

Our goal when we do research is to address capabilities and technologies that
we expect to become production-ready in one to two years. That focus on
fast-moving areas means that new algorithmic ideas sometimes come along that
allow our clients to extend or improve upon the work in our reports. Prompted in
part by Yue Dong's March 2018 _[Survey on Neural Network-Based Summarization
Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04589)_, we thought we'd take some time to
describe the developments in text summarization since our report was published. 

Put simply: there's bad news and there's good news.

The bad news is that we still don't think _abstractive_ summarization is ready
for production prime time. _Extractive_ summarization involves selecting a few
passages from a document or corpus and stitching them together to form a
summary. As we discuss in our report, [this is a tough
problem](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/04/11/new-tools-to-summarize-text.html).
But _abstractive_ summarization is harder still. Not only must you identify the
salient ideas, but you must also generate new text that expresses those ideas
concisely.

There has been considerable progress along these lines. The current state of
the art is 2017's attention-based pointer networks, e.g. [work from Abigail See
and collaborators at Stanford and Google
Brain](http://www.abigailsee.com/2017/04/16/taming-rnns-for-better-summarization.html)
and [Salesforce Research's work lead by Romain
Paulus](https://einstein.ai/research/your-tldr-by-an-ai-a-deep-reinforced-model-for-abstractive-summarization).

However, those authors would concede what [Noah Weber and collaborators showed
last month](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07038): in practice, these abstractive
networks work by "mostly, if not entirely, copying over phrases, sentences, and
sometimes multiple consecutive sentences from an input paragraph, effectively
performing extractive summarization." So, for now at least, you get the training
data requirements and engineering complexity of cutting-edge deep learning
without the practical performance increase. Which is not to say academic work
on abstractive summarization is at a dead end; we look forward to reporting on the
inevitable breakthroughs in a year or two.

In the meantime, we promised good news!

The good news is a couple of really nice papers that make concrete improvements
to _extractive_ summarization. Both are from the same Edinburgh group. [Neural
Extractive Summarization with Side
Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04530) (2017) takes advantage of a very
natural heuristic that was used in classical summarization algorithms: titles
and image captions are particularly strong signals of the important ideas in a
document. This heuristic is incorporated into an attention-based
encoder-decoder network, and they get [really nice extractive
results](http://kinloch.inf.ed.ac.uk/sidenet.html). If your source documents
have that kind of structure, this approach is worth investigating. More
ambitiously, in [Ranking Sentences for Extractive Summarization with
Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08636) (2018) the same group
recasts extractive summarization as a reinforcement learning task. Unusually,
they learn to _rank_ sentences in the source document rather than score them in isolation, which they argue results in more coherent (and less verbose) overall
summaries.

So, two years after our report, text summarization remains not only a useful
business capability, but a very vibrant area of research.

## Rules to Learn By

Longtime readers of this newsletter know that we follow the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning conversation closely (see [here](https://fatconference.org/2018/index.html) and [here](https://www.fatml.org/)). These conversations address and attempt to mitigate the potential for technical systems to produce unfairness. Much of this unfairness arises from how algorithmic systems might perpetuate historical inequalities or otherwise produce discriminatory effects. This conversation is broader than could be encapsulated in any newsletter, but we want to point to some recommendations that have come out of this conversation to demonstrate how we think through the challenges of building models that don't learn or perpetuate bias. We embrace these challenges not just because of an overriding ethical commitment to build safely, but also because addressing these challenges helps us build things that work better than they otherwise might. 

Joanna Bryson identifies three sources of bias, and offers recommendations for how to fix the the problems they pose. With the intention of generalizing Bryson's [analysis](https://joanna-bryson.blogspot.com/2017/07/three-very-different-sources-of-bias-in.html?m=1) to all machine learning, we'd like to restate her argument slightly by identifying the sources of bias as 1) bias in the training data (with the assumption that historical biases tend to be represented in datasets), 2) bias in the assumptions and intuitions that guide our model, and 3) the bias of unintended consequences. Taking these as three sources of bias leads to three recommendations that are also best practices for machine learning. 

Bias in the real world (and therefore in the data available for training an algorithm) can be thought of as a class imbalance, regardless of where it comes from. There are acute disparities in how members of different populations are represented in datasets, due to historical social and economic inequities, but rather than perpetuating this disparate representation in machine learning, data can be balanced at the training step and thereby produce a more balanced representation in the model. This is true of all data as well; we still strive to produce balanced representations in any model we build. For an image classifier, if photographs of, say, "hamburgers with fries" are underrepresented in the training data set, the classifier might not work as well across all food items as it might if trained on balanced classes. While humans and hamburgers are very different things, ethically speaking, any machine learning model should learn robust, balanced representations.

Bias in the assumptions and intuitions that guide our models arises from how we ask and answer questions in machine learning. Bryson refers to this source of bias as "poorly reasoned rules," but this source of bias can also arise from a lack of robust product testing. Because our own life experience and domain expertise is necessarily partial, we cannot necessarily account for all the ways in which a system might not work as expected. Bryson gives the example of facial recognition not working well for people with dark skin: if we don't ask whether or not our system works well for all skin tones, it may not work as expected (see Joy Buolamwini's [project](http://gendershades.org/) on this). One solution to this problem is to develop robust testing pipelines prior to deployment; another solution is to bring in people with diverse sources of expertise and lived experiences to inform the assumptions that guide development and testing; a third solution is to think deeply and broadly about the world in which systems will be deployed. They may work exactly as designed when in 'the lab,' but produce unexpected results when deployed. The rules we have in mind about how the world behaves should correspond with the actual world beyond the lab.

The bias of unintended consequences is closely related to the causes of unexpected results, and arises in part from uninterpretable and opaque black box models. When models don't behave as expected it can be difficult to understand why they misbehaved. Developing (and utilizing) tools that enable interpretability (such as [LIME](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/09/01/LIME-for-couples.html)) and auditing algorithms with them can help developers and users understand why a certain result was returned, can identify sources of bias in a model that can then be fixed, and can even result in new and useful insights that have value as [products](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/09/28/the-product-possibilities-of-interpretability.html). Bias, in the sense that Joanna Bryson discusses it, perpetuates some of the most harmful tendencies in society. Correcting for that bias is of profound ethical value to society - in machine learning, it also focuses our attention on the things we want to be able to learn (for example, how to create more robust representations of risk factors for disease without overfitting a model to signals that distract from the end goal).
