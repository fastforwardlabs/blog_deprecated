## Machine learning and IoT combine to make real-world impact
_by [Alice](https://twitter.com/AliceAlbrecht)_

Scientists and researchers are pairing up with domain experts in various areas to apply machine learning techniques to the types of data collected from sensors in ways we could only dream of a decade ago. The results of these collaborations will only become more prevalent, and this week we'll walk through two recent successful collaborations that highlight some of the promise of translating cutting-edge machine learning research into applicable ideas that could fuel consumer products that may help solve some of the worlds hardest problems.

First, a recent challenge won by Microsoft research team [Sonoma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sonoma/), which aims to develop autonomous indoor farms. The work done on this team combines agricultural domain expertise with new research in Bayesian, deep, and reinforcement learning. The challenge was the [autonomous greenhouse competition](http://www.autonomousgreenhouses.com/), set up by Wageningen University & Research and sponsored by Tencent. Sonoma won by training a combination of machine learning models on data collected from indoor farms.

Advances in indoor farming, while potentially helping avoid a world food-shortage crisis, also provides fertile ground for research in reinforcement learning. Both indoor and outdoor controlled farming increasingly depends on both sensor and drone technology to measure and control the factors that affect plant growth. With massive amounts of data being collected and clear outcomes recorded (whether plants thrive or not), we anticipate that collaborations between machine learning and agricultural researchers will continue to propel each field forward.

Turning away from farming and instead to the difficulty in correctly diagnosing mental health disorders, [recent research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08592) from Fei-Fei Li’s group illustrates how multi-modal facial expression and spoken language data can be combined to lead to improvements in depression screening. This work was presented this year at NeurIPS and illustrates how combining multiple widely-available types of data (which could be collected on smartphones) can enable practitioners to make faster and perhaps more accurate diagnoses. In a technical sense, this work is also novel in that it used sentence-, instead of word-level embeddings, and is able to glean good model performance with low-resolution facial image data (which allows for anonymizing participants’ data). This type of human-machine interaction holds particular promise because humans are more likely to disclose certain types of information to machines. 

We are excited to see how the IoT and machine learning, in combination with deep expertise in different fields will allow us to tackle problems that were previously too costly or even impossible.
