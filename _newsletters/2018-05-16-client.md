Hello! (TODO: add intro)

## Boycotting Nature

A large segment of the machine learning research community has [joined a boycott](https://openaccess.engineering.oregonstate.edu/) of _Nature Machine Intelligence_, a new [planned academic journal](https://medium.com/syncedreview/natures-machine-intelligence-journal-to-launch-in-jan-2019-1e27858b97b6) annouced by publisher Springer, which already publishes _Nature_ and _Scientific American_; the main issue is that Springer intends to charge for publication and subscription to the journal.

Almost three thousand researchers (so far) have signed a statement rejecting closed-access research in the field of machine learning - and rightly so. The field of machine learning has a long history of openly publishing foundational research papers. As the statement notes, "In addition to JMLR, virtually all of the major machine learning outlets including NIPS, ICML, ICLR, COLT, UAI, and AISTATS make no charge for access to or publication of papers." Sites like arXiv.org allow free publication and access to computer science and mathematics research papers.

Indeed, it is common for for-profit companies, including Google and Microsoft (and even Apple, which is not known for a culture of openness or sharing) to publish machine learning research openly, and to [share some of their tools as open-source software](https://opensource.google.com/projects/list/machine-learning). Machine learning researchers at Facebook, Apple, Google, and Microsoft (to name a few) have signed the statement.

Springer's motivation in creating a closed-access machine learning journal is clearly profit-seeking, and window dressing for its [initial public offering](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-springer-nature-ipo/springer-nature-to-offer-1-6-billion-euros-of-shares-in-listing-idUSKBN1HW2W3).

Professor Thomas Dettrich of Oregon State University, who began the statement, [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/tdietterich/status/990325895729594368). _Nature Machine Intelligence_ [responded](https://twitter.com/NatMachIntell/status/990503910673715200), and the [replies](https://twitter.com/Kenneth_Marino/status/990666353139892224) [to](https://twitter.com/ThomioW/status/990587153653665792) [that](https://twitter.com/LippertChr/status/990561207743590401) response have been [appropriately critical](https://twitter.com/Issamou3/status/990706694756814848).

Nothing I (Ryan) have seen suggests that Springer is offering anything other than a chance for researchers to boost Springer's share prices.

## Drive.ai

[Drive.ai recently announced](https://medium.com/@andrewng/self-driving-cars-are-here-aea1752b1ad0) an on-demand self-driving car service pilot in Frisco, Texas. Beginning in July 2018, members of the community will be able to call these vehicles to shuttle between HALL Park offices and The Star, connecting busy offices with retail, dining, and entertainment options. The deployment of a Level 4 (high automation) self-driving system is exciting (with Level 5 being complete automation), and is de-risked in three ways. 

First, the team has designed a self-driving architecture using modern AI from the ground up; deep learning is built into mapping, perception, motion planning, localization, fleet management, telechoice (remote assistance), communications and mobile app. Second, the deployment is geofenced and accomplished via local partnerships, both public and private. This allows Drive.ai to predictably manage potential interaction issues between human and self-driving cars. Third, there is a laser focus on safety for both people inside and outside of the car. 

As a design choice, these cars are bright orange and equipped with exterior panels for communicating subtle human cues (It's safe to cross!  I'm waiting patiently). It's a first step, and we look forward to the day when these cars are free to roam safely, and communication between human and car is seamless!
