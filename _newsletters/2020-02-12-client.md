## Recommended Reading, Watching, and Listening

In this month's edition of our recommended reading list, we've branched out a bit into podcasts, talks, and videos - as well as our usual collection of articles and libraries. We also are pleased to announce that as of February 13th, our newest research report on **Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection** will be available through the client portal.  Enjoy!

### [A General Pattern for Deploying Embedding-Based Machine Learning Models](https://blog.ml6.eu/a-general-pattern-for-deploying-embedding-based-machine-learning-models-bf12e8979070) 

Capitalizing on ML requires deployment. This article outlines strategies for deploying ML models that utilize embeddings such as recommender or search systems. These are more challenging because model updates necessarily mean recalculating all the associated embeddings. The authors outline both static and streaming strategies for how to structure this production problem and minimize downtime between model upgrades.  - *[Melanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanierbeck/)*

### [Thinc.ai](https://thinc.ai/)

The machine learning library that underlies [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) has come of age. There’s a lot to love: type annotations, a composable, functional API, interop with PyTorch, TensorFlow and MXNet and even experimental Jax support. In particular the functional nature appeals to my programming preferences, so I’m hoping to spend some time exploring the library. - *[Chris](https://twitter.com/_cjwallace)*

### [How to do machine learning efficiently](https://medium.com/hackernoon/doing-machine-learning-efficiently-8ba9d9bc679d) 

This article highlights some seemingly obvious, yet often ignored, best practices for efficiently executing a machine learning project that I found very relatable. The main takeaways for me were the “10 second rule,” rushing to success, and the importance of a good validation set upfront! 

### [Towards a Conversational Agent that Can Chat About…Anything](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/towards-conversational-agent-that-can.html) 
A quick, but informative blog post that summarizes the key take away’s from Google Brain’s recently released [neural conversational model paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09977.pdf). The paper introduces Meena - a 2.6B parameter end-to-end open-domain chatbot, as well as a new human evaluation metric for chatbots called Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA) that has allowed Google to take a strong step in the right direction towards truly versatile and human-like chatbot interaction.  - *[Andrew](https://twitter.com/andrew_reed_r)*

### [Elephants Under Attack Have An Unlikely Ally: Artificial Intelligence](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/25/760487476/elephants-under-attack-have-an-unlikely-ally-artificial-intelligence)  

I first heard about [TrailGuard AI](https://www.resolve.ngo/trailguard.htm) on a podcast this week. It's an Intel project that's having significant impact in elephant conservation, and looking into it sent me down a really fun and educational rabbit trail. The NPR program linked in this article (which, among other things, covers another AI conservation solution called[ EarthRanger](https://earthranger.com/) and highlights the importance of [interpretability](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2018/07/31/progress-in-machine-learning-interpretability.html)) is fascinating, as is [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wy4u34fii4) of Intel's "Age of AI" video series. I started watching it for the segment on TrailGuard AI, but it goes on to detail other fascinating AI applications, like the work being done by [NotCo](http://www.notco.com/) to affect environmental impact in the food industry, and by [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/) to predict and pre-empt potential famine. Machine learning really does have so much potential to effect positive change in the world. -  *[Danielle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellethorp/)*

### [Podcast: On the Metal](https://oxide.computer/blog/on-the-metal-9-jonathan-blow/)

*On the Metal* is an interview podcast with people who work at the hardware/software interface. The hardware side is not something I know a lot about, so it's fun to get a glimpse at that part of the world, even if a lot of it goes over my head. It's a good reminder that computers are actual physical objects, and have all the limitations that go with that. My favorite episode of the first season was with game developer Jonathan Blow. - *[Grant](https://twitter.com/GrantCuster)*

### [Good First Issues](https://github.blog/2020-01-22-how-we-built-good-first-issues/)

Want to get involved in an open source project but don’t know where to begin?
Github's [Good First Issues](https://github.blog/2020-01-22-how-we-built-good-first-issues/)
feature connects new contributors/ programmers to find open source
projects that match their experience and interests. And, yes, it uses deep learning to do so!
Contributors often have trouble figuring out which project to be contributing to that is appropriate for their skill-set, and there is always a need for more participants when it comes to open source projects. So it's a win-win situation and impactful for the open source
movement!  -  *[Nisha](https://twitter.com/NishaMuktewar)*

### [My Python Development Environment, 2020 Edition](https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/)

How to configure the Python toolchain on a new laptop seems to change every few months at the moment. But the community seems to have reached a consensus that poetry (rather than pipenv) is what we should use. This blog post explains how to set it up, along with its friends. 


### [Databases: how they work, and a brief history](https://seldo.com/posts/databases_how_they_work_and_a_brief_history)

This breezy, non-technical explanation of databases covers some low level issues and the practical architectures you might see in the wild.

### [Why is TensorFlow 2 much slower than TensorFlow 1?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441514/why-is-tensorflow-2-much-slower-than-tensorflow-1)

One of those magical StackOverflow questions when someone who can write clearly goes deep on an interesting question. The tl;dr is "it isn't, if you know what you're doing. But if you don't, it could cost you, lots." - *[Mike](https://twitter.com/mikepqr)*

### [An Intro to the i3 Window Manager](https://fedoramagazine.org/getting-started-i3-window-manager/)

My colleague Grant turned me on to i3, a tiling window manager for Linux a couple of months ago. I tried it as a novelty, but it stuck. It's quick, flexible, and cuts distractions down. Switching over takes a bit of adaptation, but after a week or so, I had muscle memory such that I barely needed a mouse and could fly through workspaces, monitors, and windows. This is a simple intro that covers the basics and has pointers to some of the common customizations that make the transition smooth and demonstrate quickly what's great about i3. - *[Ryan](https://twitter.com/MicallefEsq)*

### [ODI Fridays: Can we please stop talking about AI for health?]( https://theodi.org/event/odi-fridays-can-we-please-stop-talking-about-ai/)

Dr. Bilal Mateen's ODI talk on the use of AI in Health, although provocatively titled, thoughtfully considers the importance of setting up the conditions for properly assessing the efficacy of AI and deploying it accordingly. I think the issues he raises will resonate with enterprise-based ML practitioners grappling with questions of good governance, while also trying to help their organizations scale up their deployment of machine learning.
