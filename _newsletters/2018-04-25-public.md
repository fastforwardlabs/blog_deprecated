## Learning to active learn

Training data is the foundation of machine learning - but because of its
expense, it is often the stumbling block, too. Active learning is a technique
that aims to reduce the time and cost of acquiring that training data. Until
recently, active learning involved arbitrary and sub-optimal heuristics. But,
by incorporating reinforcement learning in [Active One-shot
Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06559), Woodward and Finn are able to get
rid of the heuristics and make the application of active learning much more
natural.

The basic idea behind all forms of active learning is very simple, and best
explained with a short example.

Imagine a patient arrives at a hospital with symptoms of pneumonia. The doctor
can either diagnose them by applying a machine learning model to the patient's
basic symptoms, or they can perform a full examination. The machine learning
diagnosis is quick and cheap, but it might be wrong. The examination is slow
and expensive, but is guaranteed to be correct. Which technique should the
doctor use?

If the machine learning model gives not just its diagnosis, but also a measure
of its confidence, then a strategy becomes clear. If the model is almost
certain, go with its quick decision - otherwise, conduct the examination. If
the results of full examinations are used to re-train the model (to help it
become more confident the next time a patient presents with similar symptoms), then
we're doing _active learning_.

The devil is in the details, however. At what point should we trust the model?
How certain is almost certain? Traditionally, active learning sets an arbitrary
threshold. This might be in terms of confidence (e.g. "is the model at least
80% certain?") or in comparison to other samples (e.g. "is this one of the ten
pending classifications about which the model is most uncertain"), or a more
formal statistic (entropy, information gain, etc.). These approaches certainly
work, in the sense that they don't waste time expensively classifying _all_ the
data by hand. But the thresholds feel arbitrary, and it's certainly not
_optimal_ (particularly in our example). Perhaps we're manually classifying too many examples, or too few.

[Woodward and Finn's contribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06559) (presented
at NIPS 2016 and explained clearly in this [short
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzQSQ_0Z-QU)) is to get rid of these
heuristics by _learning_ a policy for whether to manually label the example.
They do this using reinforcement learning. This allows them to set the cost of
manual labeling (or mistakes by an overconfident model), in actual dollar terms
that a non-technical user knows, rather than arbitrary confidence thresholds
that a data scientist must pull out of thin air.

The end result is an end-to-end system that is seeded with a handful of manual
classifications, then rapidly becomes smarter, while asking an external labeler
for as little help as possible. We're very excited about the future of this
approach!

As a purely practical matter, reinforcement learning can be tricky to implement,
though, so there's plenty of life in the "classical" threshold-based active
learning approach yet ([reviewed in this great 2010
paper](http://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf) by Burr Settles).
If you're interested in exploring an active workflow, then we highly recommend
trying out [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) (especially the [live
demos](https://prodi.gy/demo?view_id=objectdet)). This web application
implements an active strategy and presents the manual learning component in a
thoughtful UX. It's a great tool for data scientists or end users.

## Simple Architectures Outperform Complex Ones in Language Modeling

Are novel, complex, and specialized neural network architectures always better for language modeling? [Recent papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182) have shown otherwise. Language models are used to predict the next token given the preceeding tokens. Most operate at word-level or character-level. Word-level models have large vocabulary sizes (how many words are there in the English language?) compared to character-level models (there are 26 letters in the English language). This means that character-level models require less memory. On the other hand, when processing a sentence, character-level models see a large number of tokens (each character is a token) compared to word-level models. A large number of tokens (long sequence) is harder for neural networks because of the vanishing gradients problem.                                                                      
                                                                                                      
A paper by [Salesforce research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08240) shows that a properly regulated vanilla recurrent neural network (LSTM or a cheaper counter part QRNN) can achieve state-of-the-art results on both character-level and word-level datasets. The architecture is simple: the model consists of a trainable embedding layer, one or more layers of stacked recurrent neural network, and a softmax classifier. The embedding and softmax classifier layers utilize tied weights, meaning that these two layers share the same weight. To speed up the model (slow because of large vocabulary sizes), a version of adaptive softmax extended to allow for tied weights is used. The network is regularized using DropConnect (generalization of DropOut where the weights, rather than nodes, are set to zero) on the recurrent hidden-to-hidden weight matrices to prevent overfitting on the recurrent connections. This regularization approach does not require any modifications to an RNN's formulation and allows black box RNN implementations to be used. Black box implementations are preferred because they often run faster due to low-level hardware-specific optimizations.

##### Relative importance of hyperparameters for word-level task on the smaller WikiText-2 dataset using QRNN [(image source)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08240)

In addition to achieving state-of-the-art results, experiments with the above model show that QRNN is less successful than LSTM at character-level tasks, even with substantial hyperparameter tuning. [QRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576) combines the best of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). It allows for parallel computation across both timestep and minibatch dimensions (CNN) while retaining sequential information (RNN). In doing so, it uses a simplified hidden-to-hidden transition function which is element-wise rather than full-matrix multiplication. The authors conjecture that this simplified transition function prevents full communication between hidden units in the RNN, making it less suitable for character-level language models. The experiments on QRNN also show that weight dropout is the most important hyperparameter - the number of layers and dimension sizes matters relatively less. We think the paper is interesting because it: i) confirms that novel and complex is not always better; ii) shows character-level and word-level models are not easily transferable; and iii) attempts to rank hyperparameter importance (useful!)

## Any application that *can* be written in JavaScript *will* eventually be written in JavaScript: deep learning and notebooks edition

Google recently announced [TensorFlow.js](https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tensorflow-js-machine-learning-in-javascript-bf3eab376db), an open-source library for running machine learning in the browser, and a successor to the deeplearn.js library. While the majority of machine learning work is unlikely to shift to JavaScript anytime soon, the examples included on the [TensorFlow.js site](https://js.tensorflow.org/) do a good job of showing the promise of machine learning models that run in the browser. 

![A short GIF of the Teachable Machines demo showing Grant raising his hand and the model responding with a GIF of a cat waving.]({{ site.github.url }}/images/editor_uploads/2018-03-31-210319-hicat2.gif)

##### Teachable Machine lets you train a model to help you wave at cats.

Our favorite example is [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), which walks you through a training process using images from your webcam to trigger response GIFs. It shows how training in the browser can help the model adapt to different contexts. For example, if you want your model to spot when a user raises their hand, a pre-trained model might have trouble if the user is sitting in a room surrounded by mannequins. Because you can train the Teachable Machine model with specific examples of both "raised hand" and "unraised hand," there's a good chance it will perform well in your weird mannequin room (a very specific situation). A related webcam-based example is the work [Oz Ramos](https://twitter.com/LearnWithOz) is doing to build a system for navigation using facial gestures, to help people with mobility impairments use the web.

Another advantage of having deep learning code running in the browser is that you can open up the code itself for people to interact with. Better JavaScript deep-learning tools mean more web-based interactive deep-learning explainers: explainers like [Minsuk Kahng's Deep Learning Tutorial](https://beta.observablehq.com/@minsukkahng/deep-learning-tutorial-with-deeplearn-js), which shows how to use deeplearn.js to build a model for the Iris dataset. Because all of the code for the system is exposed and editable, viewers cans tweak different parameters and easily view the results. 

![A screenshot form a section of Minsuk Kahng's Deep Learning Tutorial. It shows the model code and a slider for specifying the number of neurons in the hidden layer.]({{ site.github.url }}/images/editor_uploads/2018-03-31-210737-Screen_Shot_2018_03_30_at_4_59_56_PM.png)

##### Minsuk Kahng's deeplearning.js node lets you edit the code and immediately view the results.

Kahng's tutorial is built on the new JavaScript notebook site [Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com/@minsukkahng/deep-learning-tutorial-with-deeplearn-js). Made by D3.js creator Mike Bostock and others, Observable makes it easy to build interactive and modifiable JavaScript examples of all types. Along with sites like [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) and [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), Observable is leading a renaissance of interactive code examples and explainers. Grant has used Observable for [everything from using three.js for 2D data visualization to finding out how long it takes a browser to say different numbers out loud.](https://beta.observablehq.com/@grantcuster)
