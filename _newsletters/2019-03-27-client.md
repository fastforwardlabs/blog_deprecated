Hello! In this week's newsletter, we highlight our new research on [Learning with Limited Labeled Data](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/03/20/learning-with-limited-labeled-data.html), and take a deep dive into Bootstrapping ML Experimentation with Tensorflow Hub.

## Machine Learning with Limited Labeled Data

Our latest research report and prototype (which will be released next week!) explores learning with limited labeled data. This capability relaxes the stringent labeled data requirement in supervised machine learning and opens up new product possibilities. It is industry invariant, addresses the labeling pain point and enables applications to be built faster and more efficiently. 

Please join us on Wednesday, April 3rd at 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET for a webinar introducing the report.  The webinar will be hosted by Shioulin Sam and Nisha Muktewar, with special guests Ines Montani (co-founder of Explosion AI) and Sanjay Krishnan (Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago).  You can register [here](https://www.cloudera.com/about/events/webinars/learning_with_limited_labeled_data.html?src=FFL) - and be sure to check out our latest blogpost on [Learning with Limited Labeled Data](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/03/20/learning-with-limited-labeled-data.html), too.
