### Introduction
This is the first part of a series to review Bias in Knowledge Graphs (KG). We aim to describe methods of identifying bias, measuring its impact, and mitigating that impact. For this part, we’ll give a broad overview of this topic.

### Motivation
Knowledge graphs, graphs with built-in ontologies, create unique opportunities for data analytics, machine learning, and data mining. They do this by enhancing data with the power of connections and human knowledge. Microsoft, Google, and Facebook actively use knowledge graphs in their products, and the interest from large and medium enterprises is accelerating. Andrew Reed gives a great overview of knowledge graphs in a [previous article](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2020/01/29/a-symbiotic-relationship-knowledge-graphs-and-machine-learning.html).

How are knowledge graphs used? Often they are deployed in the backend of an application, for example, supporting search results or responses from conversational AI. In other cases, knowledge graphs are used more directly to grow a knowledge base by finding or validating new information.

As the usage of this technology ramps up, bias in these systems becomes a problem that can contaminate results, degrading the user experience or driving bad decisions. In the last 1-2 years, interest has grown in identifying and removing bias.

Here are some hypothetical cases where bias in knowledge graphs could raise issues:

__Conversational AI__: Catherine, a college junior, interacts with a ‘career bot’, a conversational AI agent that offers job advice to graduating students. A knowledge graph based on the university’s record of successful alumni underpins the AI agent. Catherine is a pre-med major with aspirations to become a surgeon. In the school’s records, most successful surgeons are male. The conversational AI steers Catherine towards medical fields where there are historically more women.

__Search__: John is using a search engine to research vaccines. He is a layman with no deep knowledge of this area. The search results include hyperlinks and a sidebar of information and links generated from a large structured data source (based on “Wiki-Encyclopedia”). Wiki-Encyclopedia’s article has been curated and updated by many people who have strong -- but false --  notions about the side-effects and efficacy of vaccines. As a result, when John reviews the search results and sidebar, he comes away with flawed -- not well informed -- notions about vaccines.

__Knowledge Base Building__: A hospital is building and expanding a knowledge graph. Part of this process involves algorithmically accepting or rejecting new ‘facts’ to add to the knowledge graph. If the foundational data is itself biased, it could lead to the machine rejecting legitimate facts that go against the bias of the foundational data.

### Types of Bias
In general, our work is focused on bias that results in “systematic errors of judgment and decision making” by the consumers of KG & ML applications*.

Bias is a broad topic, which has many context-dependant definitions. Data scientists and statisticians are concerned with bias that is more technical and measurable, while less technical stakeholders may have their own definitions and standards for identifying when bias occurs.

Within the machine learning community, several types of bias have been identified and studied (Mehrabi, et. al. define 23 types of bias relevant to machine learning in a recent paper.)

### Bias Along the ML/Analytical Pipeline
Aside from the types of bias, there are also places in the stages of an analytical or machine learning pipeline where bias can be identified.

__Data__. Structured and unstructured data form the raw materials for building knowledge graphs. This data can be crowd-sourced, as with Wikipedia and Amazon's Mechanical Turk, or it can be gathered and curated privately, as with a private corporation’s records and transactions.

If data was generated by people with a prevalent opinion (self-selection bias) or from a majority of people of a certain cultural perspective (sometimes called representational or population bias), this can impact the downstream results.
An example of self-selection bias is when customers who have strong motivations write service reviews. These may not reflect that majority of customers, but if a knowledge graph is built on top of such data, it may learn a distorted view of customer sentiment.

__Semantic/Ontology__. Ontologies are a framework of meaning which supports the input data and their relationships. Such frameworks are constructed top-down or bottoms-up, and can be manually designed or formed algorithmically. If built by a team of experts, conscious and representational bias can impact the structure of the ontology. If built by machine, bias in the underlying data can bleed into the ontology.

An example can be found in geographical ontologies. Anthropocentric biases lead designers to over emphasize human-centric locations versus natural ones. The Place branch of the DBpedia ontology (as of 2015), contained “dozens or even hundreds of classes for various sub-classes of restaurants, bars, and music venues, but only a handful of classes for natural features such as rivers” [Jancowicz].

__Knowledge Graph Embeddings__. Embeddings are lower-dimensional representations that enable more efficient processing of knowledge graph data, which is normally in a high-dimensional, and hard-to-wrangle form. It has recently been shown that social biases in knowledge graphs can get passed on to their respective embeddings [Fisher].

__Inferential__. Inference refers to when a query, machine learning algorithm, or fact-learning algorithm learns from a knowledge graph, or its embeddings. An oft-mentioned example is that of an inferential algorithm learning that only men can be the US President, because historically that has been the only case.

### Next Article
In the next part of this series, we’ll examine in more detail concrete examples of the data and ontology bias, and examine known methods to detect and measure such bias.

We'd like to highlight [this article](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2020/02/27/privacy,-data-governance,-and-machine-learning-the-regulatory-perspective.html) about the regulatory perspective on privacy, data governance, and machine learning by [Varun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varun-bhatnagar-74303437/) on the Cloudera Fast Forward blog, but here are a few other interesting reads, as well:

#### [A Review of Neural Approaches to the Question Answering Task](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2537/paper-14.pdf)
A brief primer on the state of research and engineering in Question Answering. If you don't know a ton about question answering, but you've heard all the hype about BERT and the other fancy pre-trained models out there, this is a good (and fast) overview of what things were and what just changed.- *[Ryan](https://twitter.com/MicallefEsq)* 

#### [Reliance on Metrics is a Fundamental Challenge for AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08512.pdf) 
Ask 10 people what they think are the biggest challenges facing AI and you’ll probably get 10 different answers - anything from hurdles to implementation and adoption, to inherent biases exhibited in many of these systems, to their general inability to generalize. But underneath all of these challenges lies another that’s arguably more fundamental. This provocative paper critically examines the way that deep learning systems *learn* and demonstrates that overemphasis of metrics can lead to myriad unintended consequences. - *[Melanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanierbeck/)*

#### [A Primer in BERTology: What we know about how BERT works](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12327.pdf)

Solving the labeled data problem using GANS - with DermGAN one can "create synthetic images for pre-specified skin condition while being able to vary its size, location and underlying skin color." - *[Shioulin](https://twitter.com/shioulin_sam)*

#### [(Podcast) Future of Programming: Orca with Devine Lu Linvega](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/045)

Orca, a unique visual programming language, is fascinating to me. It's great to hear its creator, Devine Lu Linvega, talk through its puzzle-game origins and how the community around it developed.  - *[Grant](https://twitter.com/GrantCuster)*

#### [Program design in the UNIX environment](http://harmful.cat-v.org/cat-v/unix_prog_design.pdf)

This 1983 paper examines the then state of the UNIX programs we know and love, like cat, ls and pr. It is mostly praising the simplicity and modularity of their earlier implementations, and bemoaning the conflated functions that had even then begun to creep in. I am enamoured with the UNIX philosophy of small, sharp tools that do one well-defined thing (and do it well), and I think that philosophy is every bit as relevant almost 40 years on. -  *[Chris](https://twitter.com/_cjwallace)*

#### [Data Discovery Tools at Spotify](https://labs.spotify.com/2020/02/27/how-we-improved-data-discovery-for-data-scientists-at-spotify/) 

Organizations are continuously expanding their data science and analytics footprint by hiring more and more talent into data-focused roles. With this influx of analytics practitioners comes a need to centralize and share the fruitful data insights that are uncovered. To help ensure insights aren't stuck locally within a team, Spotify has developed library tool - called Lexikon - for cataloguing and exposing data and insights across the organization. - *[Andrew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-r-reed/)*

#### [fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastpages/jupyter/2020/02/21/introducing-fastpages.html)

A platform which allows you to create and host a blog free of advertisements! ML practitioners often share their modeling results with visualizations, text, raw output numbers and at times with even a bit of a code! That said, not every reader is interested in code. To address this problem, fast.ai and Github have teamed up to release fastpages, a blogging platform (built on Github pages for hosting and powered by nbdev) that enables users to include interactive content including collapsable code cells, data tables, visualizations. With fastpages, users can easily convert a Jupyter notebook, Word document, or Markdown file into a content-rich blog post. It also allows for embedding Twitter cards and Youtube videos. - *[Nisha](https://twitter.com/NishaMuktewar)*
