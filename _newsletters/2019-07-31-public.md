Hello, and welcome to the July edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward Labs newsletter!  July has been an exciting month for the CFFL team; we have just released two new research reports and prototypes on text and image analysis. We also held a [virtual event](https://www.cloudera.com/about/events/webinars/cffl-virtual-event-7-2019.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=ml&src=newsletter&cid=7012H000001l3VK&utm_content=FFL_Showcase_Organic_AMER_Webinar_2019-07-24) introducing the reports, and our new [experiments portal](https://experiments.fastforwardlabs.com/)! Read on to learn more!

## Taking Snorkel for a spin
by *[Shioulin](https://twitter.com/shioulin_sam)* and *[Nisha](https://twitter.com/NishaMuktewar)*

Active learning, which we explored in [our report on Learning with Limited Labeled Data](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/04/02/a-guide-to-learning-with-limited-labeled-data.html), makes it possible to build machine learning models with a small set of labeled data. The typical simplified workflow when tackling a supervised machine learning problem is to i) locate the data, ii) create labels for all available data (the more the merrier), and iii) build a model. Instead of labeling all available data, active learning takes advantage of collaboration between humans and machines to smartly pick a small subset of data to be labeled. A machine learning model is then built using this small subset of data.

At the heart of active learning is the ability to identify difficult datapoints. Once identified, a human steps in to provide precise, high quality labels. But instead of asking a human to provide labels, can we write a function to programmatically create the labels? It turns out that the function that we are able to write does not always do a good job of labeling complex classification problems - the labeling function is typically based on heuristics and guesses. A single labeling function then, is not powerful enough. But what if we combine many such functions, and use the agreements and disagreements between them to figure out what the most likely label is; would that work?

This is the premise of [Snorkel](https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel) - a weak supervision framework.

We took Snorkel for a spin, and invite you to read our post about it [here](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/07/08/snorkel_final.html)!

## New research: Transfer Learning for Natural Language Processing

by *[Seth](https://twitter.com/shendrickson16)*

All around us we are seeing automated systems that are getting better and better at processing natural language. Machines that can work directly with natural language are powerful, especially as a human interface, because language is the most direct way in which we communicate. The potential impact of such systems is immense.

But systems that can do useful things with language must be intelligent - natural language is extremely complex, after all. Increasingly, machine learning algorithms are used to build this type of intelligence by allowing machines to automatically learn patterns of language.

Natural language processing (NLP) technologies using deep learning can translate language, answer questions, and generate human-like text. But these deep learning techniques require large, costly labeled datasets, expensive infrastructure, and often scarce expertise. Transfer learning lifts these constraints by reusing and adapting a model's understanding of language, making it a good fit for any NLP application. In our new report on Transfer Learning for NLP, we show how to use transfer learning to build high-performance NLP systems with minimal resources; you can learn more about this report [here](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/07/17/new-research-transfer-learning-for-natural-language-processing.html).

Alongside the report, we built a new prototype called [Textflix](https://textflix.fastforwardlabs.com/), a sentiment analysis prototype that uses movie reviews to show how machine learning can unlock the data embedded in large amounts of unstructured text  - without requiring substantial effort to label data.

## New research: Deep Learning for Image Analysis
by *[Victor](https://twitter.com/vykthur)*

A lot of advances have taken place in the image analysis space over the past few years. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) now excel at learning meaningful representations of features and concepts within images. These capabilities make CNNs extremely valuable for solving problems in domains such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, manufacturing, robotics, and urban planning. In this report, we show how to select the right deep learning models for image analysis tasks, and discuss techniques for debugging deep learning models.

This report is also accompanied by a new prototype, called [ConvNet Playground](https://convnetplayground.fastforwardlabs.com/#/), an interactive visualization for exploring Convolutional Neural Networks, applied to the task of semantic image search. In this prototype, we leverage pre-trained CNNs in extracting representations of images in our dataset and compute similarity as the distance between vectors for any pair of images. By exploring the performance of various CNN model architectures, the user can build intuition on how CNNs work and how to best apply them to specific problems.  You can learn more about this report and prototype [here](
