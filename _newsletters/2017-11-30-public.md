Hello, and welcome to the Cloudera Fast Forward Labs public newsletter. Some of you have been subscribers for months (if not years): we value your readership, feedback, and comments.

Others of you are recent subscribers; welcome! About once a month, we share our take on recent developments within machine learning, data science, computer science, statistics (and yes, AI). We cover technical innovation and provide context to cut through excessive excitement or wallowing worry, a frequent companion in today's reporting on ML/AI. We also report on some of the human aspects of building successful data products: software is still written by people and products are still built for people. 

Comments or questions? Feel free to reach out to us ([contact@fastforwardlabs.com](mailto:contact@fastforwardlabs.com)\), or tweet at us ([@FastForwardLabs](https://twitter.com/fastforwardlabs)\), anytime!

## Natural Language Processing of 22M+ Comments: On Net Neutrality

Jeff Kao used natural language processing to [analyze net neutrality comments](https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6) submitted to the FCC from April to October 2017. He found that less than 800,000 of the 22M+ comments can be considered truly unique. Of the unique comments, more than 99% appear to be in favor of net neutrality (most fake comments appear to be pro-repeal and against net neutrality). A free internet will always be filled with competing narratives. Data, research, and dialogue can help us cut through the online static and establish a shared truth.

## On Cars and Mobility Pods

Bob Lutz, former vice chairman and head of product development at General Motors, muses about a future alongside and inside [mobility pods](http://www.autonews.com/article/20171105/INDUSTRY_REDESIGNED/171109944/bob-lutz:-kiss-the-good-times-goodbye), an imaginative piece shared widely over the last couple weeks. 

> *The vehicles, however, will no longer be driven by humans because in 15 to 20 years — at the latest — human-driven vehicles will be legislated off the highways.*

> *The tipping point will come when 20 to 30 percent of vehicles are fully autonomous. Countries will look at the accident statistics and figure out that human drivers are causing 99.9 percent of the accidents.*

We recommend Rodney Brooks' excellent piece on the [Unexpected Consequences of Self Driving Cars](https://rodneybrooks.com/unexpected-consequences-of-self-driving-cars/):

> *In the little side streets, when at a stop sign, cars will have to judge when someone is about to cross in front of them. But sometimes people are just chatting at the corner, or it is a parent and child waiting for the school bus that pulls up right there. How long should the driverless car wait? And might someone bully such cars by teasing them that they are about to step off the curb – people don’t try that with human drivers as there will soon be repercussions, but driverless cars doing any percussioning will just not be acceptable.*

Engineers think about edge cases. And, that's where it gets *hard,* especially when it comes to self-driving cars which can't make too many mistakes once deployed on city streets.

## Turbulent Times in Tech: The Senate Hearing & Media Manipulation

Turbulent times in tech! Facebook, Twitter, and Google reported to a senate hearing ... on Halloween, no less. We recommend Ben Thompson's [Tech Goes To Washington](https://stratechery.com/2017/tech-goes-to-washington/) for an analysis of the hearing (we also recommend the videos embedded in the article, as they portray a collision of two worlds).

To frame the debate and better understand media manipulation and disinformation, we recommend Data & Society's report on - well - [Media Manipulation and Disinformation Online](https://datasociety.net/output/media-manipulation-and-disinfo-online/), which outlines how technology-savvy extremist groups take advantage of the digital world and hack the attention economy.

Alongside Data & Society's report, we recommend an article on ["odd" children's entertainment](https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2) (which you may not encounter, even if you have kids, but your kids might encounter it). It helps disentangle the effects of politics from the effects of algorithms, the attention economy, and ad-based business models.

We celebrate the achievements of ML/AI when artificial agents beat humans in game play (most recently, Go playing [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/)). Comparatively, [games are easy](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/10/25/alphago-zero.html). Once algorithms become part of the real world, in the form of algorithmic news feeds, for example, they become part of a complex system; effects become harder to foresee.

## The promise of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)

Earlier this month The New York Times published an article on [Building A.I. That Can Build A.I.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/technology/machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-ai.html). There is a lot of excitement about AutoML due to the scarcity of machine learning (ML) talent:

> *By some estimates, only 10,000 people worldwide have the education, experience and talent needed to build the complex and sometimes mysterious mathematical algorithms that will drive this new breed of artificial intelligence.*

Furthermore, ML/AI experts are expensive: [Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I. Talent](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html?_r=0). AutoML promises _more ML at lower cost_; it is an enticing offering.

### The multiple meanings of AutoML

That said, the realistic promise of new capabilities is hard to grasp. There are at least three different notions of AutoML:

 - **Citizen Data Science / ML**: AutoML will allow everyone to do data science and ML. It requires no special training or skills.
 - **Efficient Data Science / ML**: AutoML will supercharge your data scientists and ML engineers by making them more efficient.
 - **Learning to Learn**: AutoML will automate architecture and optimization algorithm design (much like neural networks automated feature engineering).
 
 We could add a fourth:

  - **Transfer Learning**: AutoML will allow algorithms to learn new tasks faster by utilizing what they have learned from mastering other tasks in the past.

Google Brain's AutoML project is about [Learning to Learn](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/using-machine-learning-to-explore.html):

> *Typically, our machine learning models are painstakingly designed by a team of engineers and scientists. This process of manually designing machine learning models is difficult because the search space of all possible models can be combinatorially large — a typical 10-layer network can have ~1010 candidate networks! For this reason, the process of designing networks often takes a significant amount of time and experimentation by those with significant machine learning expertise.*

Learning to learn is very exciting! But it requires extensive computational resources for model training, the kind Google has access to, but not many others. By providing access to (cloud) compute power, of course, AutoML as *Learning to Learn* is an excellent strategy to monetize Google's cloud compute offering; Google has an excellent *business case* for investing time and resources into the AutoML project (of course).  But experts suugest it will take a while before the promise of AutoML as *Learning to Learn* will materialize:

> *Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. “It is just a matter of when,” he said.*

We agree. So how about the promise of the other notions of AutoML?

There are data science and ML platform vendors that promise to automate data science and ML to the extent that *Citizen Data Science / ML* may soon became real (e..g, [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/)). Data science and ML practitioners, however, are skeptical about the promise of Citizen Data Science (and, frankly, worried about some of its outputs and consequences).

We believe AutoML as *Efficient Data Science / ML* shows real promise for the largest number of companies within the near to midterm future. There is ample opportunity to improve the data science and ML work flow, and to automate parts of it, to make your data professionals more effective.

### The promise of AutoML as Efficient Data Science

The typical ML system can be broken down into a number of different components, or modules, each with a different aim and focus.

##### The different components of ML systems. Only a small fraction of real-world ML systems are composed of the ML code. To put ML to work requires complex surrounding infrastructure (taken from the paper [*Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems*](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf)).

ML code, while important, is only a small fraction of the code base authored by data teams (and their colleagues) to put algorithms to work. And, even the best, highest accuracy models are useful only in production. In production, they need monitoring, and (eventually) retraining. Building and maintaining these often fragile ML pipelines is expensive, both in time and effort. In the process, teams often build up [significant technical debt](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf).

[Uber](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/) and [Google](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/tfx-a-tensorflow-based-production-scale-machine-learning-platform) recently published papers describing their ML platforms. Their platforms inform us about the challenges they faced putting ML to work. 

Google's platform is built with an emphasis on systems capable of detecting failure and bugs so they do not propagate into the production environment. Uber's emphasis is on making good use for institutional knowledge. Uber's platform features a feature store, where Uber's data scientists store and share (engineered) features (and, presumably, trained models) alongside the appropriate meta-data to help with discoverability (preparing the ground for *Transfer Learning*). Both provide a framework for reliably producing and deploying machine learning models at scale and promise AutoML as *Efficient Data Science / ML* (and, eventually, *Transfer Learning*).

At Cloudera (please excuse the plug), the [Cloudera Data Science Workbench](https://www.cloudera.com/products/data-science-and-engineering/data-science-workbench.html) provides a solution available to all, not just Google's or Uber's data scientists.

## Surprising correlates

Where there is money, there are vintage light bulbs. Most Westeners expect dim lights in fashionable restaurants, according to [City Lab](https://www.citylab.com/). *Solid-state Edison bulbs epitomize our tangled obsessions with both technology and an imagined urban past.*

Consequently, the presence of vintage light bulbs is a surprisingly [good proxy for measuring gentrification](https://www.citylab.com/design/2017/10/mapping-the-edison-bulbs-of-brooklyn/543738/).
