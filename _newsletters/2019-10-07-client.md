[Extreme Language Model Compression with Optimal Subwords and Shared Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11687)

Pretrained language models such as BERT, ELMo, and GPT have achieved state of the art performance for a variety of language understanding tasks. However, the size of these models make them impractical for a number of scenarios, especially on mobile and edge devices. This paper introduces a new model distillation technique (more on model distillation here https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531 ) that enables a compressed version of BERT (from 420MB to 6.8MB, over 60x compression!!) with minimal loss of accuracy. These results will directly enable the use of such high accuracy models on end user and edge devices.

[Data Shapley: Equitable Valuation of Data for Machine Learning, pdf](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/ghorbani19c/ghorbani19c.pdf)

As we think about shifting data ownership back to the generators of data and thus opening up the possiblity of compensating owners for their data, the ability to value a datapoint becomes necessary and crucial. This paper discusses one way to do so.

[Doing enterprise financial data visualization after data journalism](https://medium.com/@tophtucker/doing-enterprise-financial-data-visualization-after-data-journalism-3c68861b7f4c)

Toph Tucker writes about his experience moving into financial data visualization. The article is wonderful in its concreteness. I especially liked the discussion about how power-users have different needs then first-time viewers. This is often a tension I have to deal with in the design of our prototypes. There's a lot of curiosity-driven empathy in Tucker's explanation of why tools that may not be aesthetically appealing at first glance are actually well-designed for their purpose.

[The Wavefunction Collapse Algorithm explained very clearly](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/)

The wave function collapse algorithm, used for creating varied but coherent tilemaps, looks like the sort of thing that requires a neural network -- but it doesn't. Robert Heaton lays out how it works, using a simplified version and a wedding party metaphor to communicate the core idea. The article is interesting for its content and as an example of trying to make technical content accessible (something we focus on as well).
