## Designing Turbofan Tycoon

Our prototypes are designed to demonstrate the value of the technologies we research. For our most recent prototype, [Turbofan Tycoon](https://turbofan.fastforwardlabs.com/), we decided that the best way to demonstrate the value of [federated learning](https://clients.fastforwardlabs.com/ff09/report) was to place you in an interactive simulation where youâ€™re in charge of maintaining four turbofan engines.  Please follow [this link to our blog](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2018/12/06/designing-turbofan-tycoon.html) for this week's newsletter highlight - a deep dive from Grant Custer into the inspiration and thought behind the creation of Turbofan Tycoon.

You can learn more about federated learning [here](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2018/11/14/federated-learning.html), and if you haven't already, please be sure to let us know if you'd like to schedule a presentation on this topic, or an advising session to explore possible use cases.

* [Fifty Years of BASIC, the Programming Language That Made Computers Personal](http://time.com/69316/basic/) - Mike recommends this as a nice longread for the holidays on the history of the language with which many of us learned to code. It's interesting to think about which of today's languages will get features written about them in Time magazine in 50 years time!)
* The [NeurIPS 2018] (https://neurips.cc/) conference is just around the corner, and they have recently announced what they consider to be the best papers of this year; the "test of time award" goes to this one: [The Tradeoffs of Large Scale Learning](https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/nips-2007.pdf).

## CFFL Updates

As the holidays approach, conference season is winding down, but we'll be back on the road in 2019, and will be sure to let you know as we lock in new speaking engagements.  You can look forward to 2 more newsletters this month before we take a short hiatus.  As always, thank you for reading! We welcome your thoughts and feedback, so please do [reach out](mailto:cffl@cloudera.com) anytime.

All the best,
