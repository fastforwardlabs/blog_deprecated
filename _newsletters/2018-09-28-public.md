## The True Competitive Advantage in ML 
_by [Justin](https://twitter.com/JustinJDN)_

Data science, machine learning (ML), and AI are no longer just cute buzzwords.  Nearly all organizations, companies and governments now recognize the immense potential of AI-enabled products and services, and many of them have already made the very real investment of hiring employees with skills in these emerging fields.  

However, as is true with most things in data science, one size does not fit all!  Simply hiring a self-proclaimed data scientist or machine learning expert with advanced degrees isn't likely to fit the bill.  A successful machine learning application often requires looking at a business problem critically, crafting a creative technical solution to that problem, designing and executing (many) experiments to see if that solution is possible, and then (if so) developing a scalable way to integrate that solution into an application framework.  Expecting a single person to have all of these skills (and also to want to apply them all at the same time) is a bit much.  

Of course, the answer is to create a team full of highly competent people with creative, technical and product skills, who are all passionate about AI/ML, right?  Easier said than done!

It's becoming more and more clear that the true competitive advantage in AI/ML isn't some killer algorithm, or even a cutting-edge technology platform (complete with robust experimentation capabilities and slick visualizations); it's the ability to build, engage, and retain an awesome team.  

Much has been written on the best ways to structure data science organizations (DJ Patil even wrote [a book](https://g.co/kgs/W4irpa) on the subject!  But what are the roles that make up these prolific groups, and more importantly, how should leaders best apply the rare skills that each of these roles bring to the table?

In an article on the subject earlier this summer, Forbes describes [three critical roles](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/06/04/getting-data-science-right-how-to-structure-data-science-teams-for-maximum-results/#1ded5fd3140b):  data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning engineers.  These roles and team structure are great for smaller but agile organizations seeking to uncover AI/ML use cases and then rapidly address them with scrappy solutions.

Hackernoon takes a [more detailed approach](https://blog.google/technology/ai/making-ai-work-for-everyone/) to describing AI/ML roles in an article describing the Top 10 Roles in AI and data science.  Staffing out a team or team(s) with these skills and responsibilities might be more appealing (and realistic) for a more mature department, especially when enterprise software engineering, compliance and/or regulatory requirements, are a major consideration.

Ultimately, there are no cookie-cutter AI/ML team structures, and thus no perfect roles.  But as the community of practice grows and enjoys more and more success, best practices have certainly emerged.  For example, here at [Cloudera Fast Forward Labs](https://www.cloudera.com/content/dam/www/marketing/resources/datasheets/cloudera_fast_forward_labs_datasheet.pdf.landing.html), we often work with our customers to help them discover the right AI/ML vision, team structure, core skills, and enabling technology necessary to reach their respective AI/ML goals--and beyond!

## Snorkel: Rapid Training Data Creation with Weak Supervision
_by [Nisha](https://twitter.com/NishaMuktewar)_

Machine learning (and more specifically, deep learning) techniques are recognized for their ability to obtain high accuracy for 
a variety of classification problems. Deep learning models are more complex than most traditional models and often have 
thousands of parameters and commensurately require more labeled training data. Obtaining this data can be an expensive and time-consuming process, and often requires domain experts to help with the labeling process. Many areas of machine learning that are motivated by this bottleneck could be broadly categorized into four areas: [active learning](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3019233), [semi-supervised learning](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1841234), [weak supervision](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2017/07/16/weak-supervision/) and [transfer learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5288526/). [Snorkel](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10160) belongs to the *weak supervision* class and is effective for tasks like natural language processing. The basic idea is to allow users to provide supervision at a higher level than case-by-case labeling, and then to use various statistical techniques to deal with the noisier labels that are obtained. Working with domain experts, the Snorkel team has found that this type of supervision is easier and faster to provide. And surprisingly, by getting large volumes of lower-quality supervision in this way, one can train higher-quality models at a fraction of the time and cost. 

Snorkel is a system built around the [data programming](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly) paradigm for rapidly creating, modeling, and managing training data. It lets one use weak supervision sources like heuristics, external knowledge bases, crowdsourced labels, and more. These are called weak supervision sources because they may be limited in accuracy and coverage. All of these get combined in a principled manner to produce a set of 
probability-weighted labels. The end model is then trained on the generated labels.
##### Snorkel workflow
![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/editor_uploads/2018-09-05-182818-snorkel_workflow.png)

Snorkel's workflow has three main stages:
1. **Writing Labeling Functions**: Instead of hand-labeling large quantities of training data, users write labeling functions 
which capture patterns-based heuristics, connect with external knowledge bases (distant supervision), and so on. A labeling 
function is a Python method which, given an input, can either output a label or abstain. For instance, we can write a labeling function that checks if the word “causes” appears between the chemical and disease mentions. If it does, it outputs *True* if the chemical mention is first and *False* if the disease mention is first. If “causes” does not appear, it outputs *None*, indicating abstention. In addition, Snorkel includes a number of declarative labeling functions that can be used out of the box.
##### Example labeling function
![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/editor_uploads/2018-09-05-182951-labeling_function.png)
2. **Modeling Accuracies and Correlations**: Next, Snorkel automatically learns a generative model over the labeling functions, which allows it to estimate their accuracies and correlations. This step uses no ground-truth data, learning instead from the agreements and disagreements of the labeling functions.    

3. **Training a Discriminative Model**: The output of Snorkel is a set of probabilistic labels that can be used to train a 
wide variety of state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as popular deep learning models. While the generative model is 
essentially a re-weighted combination of the user-provided labeling functions — which tend to be precise but low-coverage - discriminative models can retain this precision while learning to generalize beyond the labeling functions, increasing 
coverage and robustness on unseen data.   

One thing to note is that it is quite possible for a user to write labeling functions that are statistically dependent (i.e., correlated). Modeling such dependencies is crucial because it affects the estimates of true labels. To help with this, Snorkel automatically selects which dependencies to model using an estimator that relies on a hyper-parameter - epsilon. With large values of epsilon, no correlations are included, and as we reduce the value progressively more correlations are added, starting with the strongest.

Snorkel is currently being used on text extraction applications for medical records at the Deparment of Veterans Affairs, to mine scientific literature for adverse drug reactions in collaboration with the Federal Drug Administration, and to comb through everything from surgical reports to after-action combat reports for valuable structured data.

## Realistic Video Generation
_by [Micha](http://micha.codes/)_

[Generative Adversarial Networks][6] (GANs) wowed the world in 2014 with their
ability to generate what we considered to be [realistic images][4]. While these
images were quite low resolution, researchers kept working on how to perfect
these methods in order to increase the quality of the images and even to apply
the algorithm on other types of data like text and sound.

![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2018/09/gan-1536758013486.png)

However, until recently there has been little success in making realistic
videos. The main problem with making videos is temporal consistency: while
people can be forgiving in one frame and find some interpretation for
unrealistic regions, we are adept at seeing inconsistencies with how videos
progress.

![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2018/09/pix2pixhd-1536757958811.gif)

For example, we can accept some strange looking texture in the background of an
image as simply some strange looking background. However, if that background is
randomly changing from frame to frame in a video, we immediately discount the
video. It is exactly this temporal consistency which has plagued researchers
trying to apply GANs to videos -- while each frame seemed realistic taken on
its own, when assembled into a video, there were considerable inconsistencies
which ruined any illusion of realism. This restricted the ability to reuse
models that showed success at generating individual images, and forced
researchers to come up with new methods to deal with the temporal nature of
videos.

![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2018/09/maxresdefault-1536763922861.jpg)

Recently, researchers at NVIDIA and MIT have come up with a new type of
GAN, [vid2vid][1], which primarily addresses this problem by explicitly
incorporating how things seem to be moving within the video, in order to continue
this motion in future frames. (In addition, they follow previous work, which uses
a multi-resolution approach for generating high resolution images). This is done
by calculating the [optical flow][5] of the image, which is a classic computer
vision method that simply has not been incorporated into such a model until now.

![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2018/09/citysmall-1536759505454.gif)

The results are quite staggering (we highly recommend watching their [release
video][2]). With the model you can create dashboard camera footage from the initial
segmentation frame (allowing you to change the type and shape of objects in the
frame by simply drawing in the corresponding color); it's even possible to create realistic looking
dance videos from pose information. It's interesting to see this new method as
[compared with previous methods][3], to really get a sense of how important this
additional temporal information is for making realistic results.

![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2018/09/pose_to_body_vid2vi2-1536757918891.gif)

These high quality results are quite exciting and are groundbreaking work in
the field of video generation. From applications in generating synthetic
training data to use in creative projects, the vid2vid model itself is instantly
applicable.

Even more interesting is how the field as a whole will learn from this
research and start finding ways to incorporate other classic algorithms into
neural networks. Just as conv-nets explicitly encoded the two dimensional
understanding we have for images into models so that they can more quickly and
accurately learn how to work with that data, this method explicitly encodes our
understanding of how frames of a video flow from one to another (albeit this was
much trickier to do than the conv-net example!). We're interested in seeing what
other algorithms will be incorporated into neural networks like this and what
capabilities these models will have.

## Apache Spark gets a machine learning makeover
_by [Seth](https://twitter.com/shendrickson16)_

### Machine learning on Spark: an abridged history

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) - the cluster computing framework 
that's been throwing shade at MapReduce since 2011 - has always been a bit 
remarkable, because it bridged the divide between data engineering and data 
science. One of the great promises of Spark was that it would be easy, 
trivial almost, to scale machine learning and data science to arbitrarily 
large data. Seven years later, Spark has made its place in data science, but 
perhaps not in the way we originally hoped.

Spark's big contribution was that it delivered a very elegant API for dealing 
with distributed collections of data, termed _Resilient Distributed Datasets_ 
(RDDs). Compared to alternatives at the time, it was simple to use that API 
to write certain machine learning algorithms, and since those algorithms were 
built on RDDs; you got fault tolerance and scale for free. It wasn't long 
until a machine learning library built on RDDs was born: [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html). 

Implementing performant, scalable machine learning algorithms in MLlib wasn't 
*quite* as easy as just expressing the logic using RDD transformations, but in 
some cases it worked quite well. Spark, and by extension MLlib, work well 
when algorithms can be expressed in parallel, independent tasks that each 
work on independent chunks of data. Accordingly, MLlib has seen success and 
adoption with linear models, K-means clustering, decision trees, and some 
others. But some algorithms, most notably deep learning, are difficult to 
express using Spark. 

In comparison to linear models, optimizing deep learning algorithms over 
distributed collections requires frequent communication between tasks. 
Further, deep learning is _slow_, if you don't use a framework that has been 
heavily optimized for that exact use case. Tensorflow, PyTorch, MXNet, etc. 
all leverage accelerated hardware and heavily optimized C/C++ code to achieve 
reasonable efficiency. All this is to say that Spark and deep learning aren't 
a very good match.  So why are we talking about it?

Deep learning needs data (big data!) and that data often needs to be accessed 
through or pre-processed by Spark. That data is also messy and is probably 
stored across many datasets in many different storage platforms. Spark makes 
reading, aggregating, and joining these datasets less awful. So even if Spark 
isn't heavily optimized for machine learning, the data that feeds these 
algorithms often goes through Spark first. This reality led many developers 
to ponder, "what if we could combine the heavily optimized ML/DL frameworks 
into Spark?" And with that, the family of XOnSpark libraries came to be.

![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/editor_uploads/2018-09-19-194511-XOnSpark.png)

But Spark hasn't made it very easy to combine these other libraries, most of 
which are written in a combination of Python and C++, with Spark. There are
three main shortcomings:

* Moving data between Spark processes (JVM) and Python processes is inefficient
* Spark task scheduling doesn't take GPUs into account
* Deep learning tasks need to constantly communicate gradient/weight updates between them, which is a Spark anti-pattern

### Project Hydrogen makes Spark play nice with other ML frameworks

To address each of these issues, the open source community for Spark is 
undertaking a new initiative, dubbed _Project Hydrogen_, which is 
broken up into three main chunks, each designed to solve one of these 
shortcomings:

* [Barrier scheduling](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24374)
* [Accelerator aware scheduling](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24615)
* [Data interchange using Apache Arrow](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24579)

The goal of Project Hydrogen is to make it easy and efficient to build deep learning workflows that can run end to end in Spark. This is exciting!

Spark and deep learning can't ignore each other, and that probably won't 
change any time soon. Because of the current complexities, it's best to avoid 
distributing deep learning training when possible. But we're excited to 
see investment into scaling deep learning with Spark. There are so many great 
libraries for doing heavily optimized machine learning - PyTorch, Tensorflow, 
XGBoost, LightGBM - that it's hugely beneficial to be able to scale these 
up with Spark.

## Patent Law Products on the Horizon

_by [Ryan](https://twitter.com/jqpubliq)_

At Cloudera Fast Forward Labs, we keep an eye out for new developments in algorithms, data, and business. Of course, building excellent data products requires sufficient data, well-selected algorithms, and a well-defined business use case. Intellectual property presents a clear set of business use cases (we'll discuss prior art searching and automated patent drafting), recently available high-quality data sets, and algorithms that are sufficiently mature and maturing still.

Andy Oram recently [reviewed](https://lwn.net/Articles/761931/) a [talk](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or-2018/public/schedule/detail/67104) given by patent attorney [Van Lindberg](https://www.dykema.com/professionals-van-lindberg.html) on the contributions and potential of machine learning in the patent field. As a computer scientist and former patent litigator, this topic is near and dear to my heart.

Lindberg's talk covered a lot of territory, including some far-future speculation (which we *love*), but two areas stood out as immediately ready for improvement: prior art searching and automated patent drafting.

Prior art searching is the hunt for scientific articles and papers, and other patents and patent applications that may be used to invalidate an existing patent (or help evaluate the likely success of a potential patent application). Prior art searching is a laborious and expensive process that can take weeks or months to turn up useful results, and the best results may not even be useful. I could not agree more with Oram and Lindberg that prior art searching is ripe for an update. With new, high-quality patent data from the US Patent and Trademark Office, from other global patent offices, and from collators (including Google), new NLP algorithms and clustering algorithms are ready to accelerate speed and improve results of prior art searches. This is a boon for patent defendants (or would-be defendants) because it helps invalidate patents that have been or may be asserted against them. But it's also helpful for potential patent applicants who need to know what else is out there that may affect the validity of their potential applications. Clarifying the patent landscape can only improve efficiency of the patent system.

Perhaps a bit farther from realization than prior art searching, automated patent generation is nonetheless getting closer to assisting patent attorneys as they draft patent applications. Our [first report](https://www.fastforwardlabs.com/research/FF01) on natural lanuage generation discussed similar use cases. Much of the work of drafting a patent application is boilerplate, and machines could be taught to handle a lot of that work. Patent applications follow a well-defined structure, especially the claims. NLG could at least provide an outline or starting text for an attorney to use as a starting point, or as a suggestion to consider when drafting an application.

Law firms are notoriously slow to adopt new technology. This may delay the advancement of these data products. But I posit that law firms will be unable to resist when outside vendors can offer lower-cost solutions with higher speed and improved accuracy.
