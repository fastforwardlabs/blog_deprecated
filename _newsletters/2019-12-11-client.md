Hello!  In this week's edition of our newsletter, we'd love to share a few things we've been reading lately.

#### [Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412)

This paper shows that Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) models are really expressive, and can be used to learn elaborate tasks in mathematics, such as symbolic integration and solving differential equations. These are typically hard tasks, and the Seq2Seq model provides a solution (to most problems) in a fraction of the time needed by traditional solvers such as Mathematica.

A while ago, I worked with a colleague to demonstrate how character-based Sequence to Sequence models can be leveraged to automatically generate visualization specifications in JSON. (See: [Data2Vis: Automatic Generation of Data Visualizations Using Sequence-to-Sequence Recurrent Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8744242).)
It is really interesting to see the extensive results in this new paper that shows how a family of Seq2Seq models can approximate even more complex math operations. - *[Victor](https://twitter.com/vykthur)*

#### [This ‘robot lawyer’ can take the mystery out of license agreements](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973830/robot-lawyer-donotpay-ai-startup-license-agreements-sign-arbitration-clauses)

This company is using NLP to help people understand the license agreements that are attached to more and more of our daily lives. Some companies default to skewed and sometimes extortionate terms that leave users with no recourse if the company changes their product, support, or prices - and it's often unclear what uses the company makes of the user's data. Even if it doesn't give users much leverage against those terms, it's good to see machine learning used as a democratization tool against [contracts of adhesion]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_form_contract#Contracts_of_adhesion). - *[Ryan](https://twitter.com/MicallefEsq)*

#### [Information Commissioner’s Office: Update report into adtech and real time bidding (PDF)](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2615156/adtech-real-time-bidding-report-201906.pdf)

I have been reading the UK ICO's report on adtech and the practice of real-time bidding (RTB) for the purpose of targeted advertising. The report was released in June and follows a review of the practices of organizations involved in facilitating RTB and the adtech that enables it. The report should make interesting reading for anyone involved in optimizing marketing spend. 

Why? Well, because as RTB has emerged as the dominant route for buying targeted advertising, the use and integration of adtech has proliferated. In fact, adtech (which is the term used to describe a broad range of technologies that support digital advertising) is such a staple in the marketer’s toolkit (and by extension companies' websites and IT ecosystems) that in recent years, some vendors have been making the case for and selling solutions that merge adtech and other marketing-focused solutions - a.k.a. ’Martech.’ 

Market watchers such as Forrester have [described this merging](https://go.forrester.com/blogs/why-the-convergence-of-adtech-and-martech-matters/) as “inevitable." The potential problem for marketing teams is that the ICO believes many implementations of advertising-related RTB (and the adtech that underpins it) in existence today are non-compliant with GDPR and by extension, infringe on customers’ rights.

Specifically, the report states that many implementations result in “the creation and sharing of personal data profiles about people, … [which] feels disproportionate, intrusive and unfair, particularly when people are often unaware it is happening” - and if things don't change the UK regulator will consider "intervention."

Given many marketing teams’ increasing integration of (and reliance on data from) adtech in the development and implementation of their marketing strategies, the ICO’s report should, at the very least, trigger a conversation with either your in-house analytics and data science teams or third-party vendors. Even if your organisation doesn’t operate in an EU country that requires GDPR compliance, increased regulatory scrutiny of corporate online practices mean that the ICO’s handling of this area is worth watching. Further, the case for proactively including governance of ‘Martech’ solutions (which in many organisations operate as ‘shadow tech’) in your broader data governance strategy is becoming stronger. - *[Ade](https://twitter.com/Adewunmi)*

#### [Visualizing and Measuring the Geometry of BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02715)

A NeurIPS sneak peek! This paper touches on two of my hobbies: explainability and NLP. The authors investigate how BERT learns what it learns by  examining what contextual embeddings mean in terms of vector spaces. They also look at areas where BERT succeeds and when it still fails spectacularly. - *[Melanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanierbeck/)*

#### [A rant about Tensorflow](https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/189464877164/attention-conservation-notice-machine-learning)

If you've had the impression that the ML community migrated away from Tensorflow as soon as a credible alternative (Pytorch!) presented itself, you're not wrong, in our experience. This blog post talks about why Tensorflow can be a frustrating project for users.

#### [Datensparsamkeit](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Datensparsamkeit.html) 

There's a German word for everything. "Datensparsamkeit is a concept from these privacy laws that is an opposite philosophy to "capture-all-the-things."

#### [black + nbconvert](https://github.com/dfm/black_nbconvert)

Make the experience of writing code in notebooks slightly less frustrating with this extension that formats your Python code with black.

#### [What Machine Learning needs from Hardware](https://petewarden.com/2019/04/14/what-machine-learning-needs-from-hardware/)

A transcript from a great talk given at the IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference earlier this year: "training scales with the number of researchers, inference scales with the number of applications times the number of users."

#### [When to switch to Python 3.8](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/major-python-release/)

The short answer is "not yet!. This blog post explains why.
