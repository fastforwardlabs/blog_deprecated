Hello! (TODO: finish intro)

### [A Review of Neural Approaches to the Question Answering Task](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2537/paper-14.pdf)
A brief primer on the state of research and engineering in Question Answering. If you don't know a ton about question answering, but you've heard all the hype about BERT and the other fancy pre-trained models out there, this is a good (and fast) overview of what things were and what just changed.- *[Ryan](https://twitter.com/MicallefEsq)* 

### [Reliance on Metrics is a Fundamental Challenge for AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08512.pdf) 
Ask 10 people what they think are the biggest challenges facing AI and you’ll probably get 10 different answers - anything from hurdles to implementation and adoption, to inherent biases exhibited in many of these systems, to their general inability to generalize. But underneath all of these challenges lies another that’s arguably more fundamental. This provocative paper critically examines the way that deep learning systems *learn* and demonstrates that overemphasis of metrics can lead to myriad unintended consequences. - *[Melanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanierbeck/)*

### [A Primer in BERTology: What we know about how BERT works](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12327.pdf)

Transformer based models (such as BERT) have shown extensive improvements for NLP tasks. This paper provides a concise overview, limitations of BERT and future work directions. - *[Victor](https://twitter.com/vykthur)*

### [DermGAN: Synthetic Generation of Clinical Skin Images with Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08716) 

Solving the labeled data problem using GANS - with DermGAN one can "create synthetic images for pre-specified skin condition while being able to vary its size, location and underlying skin color." - *[Shioulin](https://twitter.com/shioulin_sam)*

### [Podcast: Future of Programming: Orca with Devine Lu Linvega](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/045)

Orca, a unique visual programming language, is fascinating to me. It's great to hear its creator, Devine Lu Linvega, talk through its puzzle-game origins and how the community around it developed.  - *[Grant](https://twitter.com/GrantCuster)*

### [Program design in the UNIX environment](http://harmful.cat-v.org/cat-v/unix_prog_design.pdf)

This 1983 paper examines the then state of the UNIX programs we know and love, like cat, ls and pr. It is mostly praising the simplicity and modularity of their earlier implementations, and bemoaning the conflated functions that had even then begun to creep in. I am enamoured with the UNIX philosophy of small, sharp tools that do one well-defined thing (and do it well), and I think that philosophy is every bit as relevant almost 40 years on. -  *[Chris](https://twitter.com/_cjwallace)*
