Hello! (TODO: finish intro)

(Also TODO: add social links)

### [A Review of Neural Approaches to the Question Answering Task](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2537/paper-14.pdf)
A brief primer on the state of research and engineering in Question Answering. If you don't know a ton about question answering, but you've heard all the hype about BERT and the other fancy pre-trained models out there, this is a good (and fast) overview of what things were and what just changed.- [Ryan] 

### [Reliance on Metrics is a Fundamental Challenge for AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08512.pdf) 
Ask 10 people what they think are the biggest challenges facing AI and you’ll probably get 10 different answers - anything from hurdles to implementation and adoption, to inherent biases exhibited in many of these systems, to their general inability to generalize. But underneath all of these challenges lies another that’s arguably more fundamental. This provocative paper critically examines the way that deep learning systems *learn* and demonstrates that overemphasis of metrics can lead to myriad unintended consequences. - [Melanie]

### [A Primer in BERTology: What we know about how BERT works](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12327.pdf)

Transformer based models (such as BERT) have shown extensive improvements for NLP tasks. This paper provides a concise overview, limitations of BERT and future work directions. - [Victor]
