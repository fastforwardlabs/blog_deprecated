## A Guide to Learning with Limited Labeled Data

Being able to learn with limited labeled data relaxes the stringent labeled data
requirements for supervised machine learning. Our latest [research
report](https://clients.fastforwardlabs.com/) focuses on active learning, a
technique that relies on collaboration between machines and humans to label
intelligently. Active learning makes it possible to build applications using a small
set of labeled data, and enables enterprises to leverage their large pools of
unlabeled data.

Active learning takes advantage of the collaboration between humans and machines
to smartly select a small subset of datapoints for which to obtain labels.  It
is an iterative process, and ideally access is available to some initial labels
to start. These initial labels allow a human to build a baseline machine
learning model, and use it to predict outputs for all the unlabeled
datapoints. The model then looks through all its predictions, flags the one with which
it has the most difficulty, and requests a label for it. The human then steps in
to provide the label, and the newly labeled data is combined with the initial
labeled data to improve the model. Model performance is recorded, and the
process repeats.

At the heart of active learning is a machine (_learner_) that requests labels
for datapoints that it finds particularly hard to predict. The learner follows a
_strategy_, and uses it to identify these datapoints. There are many different
types of strategies: our [blog post](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/04/02/a-guide-to-learning-with-limited-labeled-data.html) gives a glimpse into some of them, and
discusses practical considerations for active learning.

To see active learning in action, please explore [our
prototype](https://activelearner.fastforwardlabs.com/)! Active Learner is a tool
that sheds light on and provides intuition for how and why active learning
works. The prototype allows one to visualize the process of active learning over
different types of datasets and selection strategies.
