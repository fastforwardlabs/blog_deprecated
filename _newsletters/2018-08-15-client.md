## Space-Saving: an efficient probabilistic algorithm to find frequent items in a stream
_by [Mike]()_

Imagine a choice between two algorithms. One takes a second to run, and can be
applied to an incomplete sample of data, but gives the wrong answer 1% of the
time. Another is guaranteed to be correct, but takes a day to run, and requires
all the data.

As we discussed in [FF02: _Probabilistic Methods for Realtime
Streams_](https://clients.fastforwardlabs.com/ff02/report), sometimes it makes
sense to choose the first, _probabilistic_ algorithm. Such algorithms make it
possible to handle a stream of data that arrives so quickly you can't even
write it to disk, much less perform a calculation.

For example, a website needs to keep track of the IP addresses of its visitors,
because attackers and ad-clickers need to be identified in a fraction of a
second, so they can be blocked or served an ad without delay. For a busy
website, this can be computationally demanding. A service like CloudFlare,
through which a non-trivial fraction of internet traffic passes (10 trillion
hits per month) [faces this challenge in the
extreme](https://www.dotconferences.com/2015/06/john-graham-cumming-i-got-10-trillion-problems-but-logging-aint-one).

To solve this problem, we need a fast, space-efficient solution to both the
_frequent_ and _top-k_ items problems. Frequent items (such as IP addresses)
are those that make up more than a certain fraction of the stream, say 1%. The
top-k items are the k that occur most often. Clearly the frequent and top-k
items are related (they're an intersecting set), and it was this connection
that lead to [the invention of
Space-Saving](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/research/tech-reports/2005-23), an
algorithm that simultaneously solves _both_ problems quickly, with excellent
precision and recall, manageable memory requirements, and probabilistic error
rate guarantees.

The basic idea in Space-Saving is to monitor the counts of only the top `m`
items (e.g. IP addresses), where `m` is a number bigger than `k`, but perhaps
not much bigger. This keeps the memory requirements down. But, of course, the top
`m` items can change, and we need a way for new items to enter our "monitored"
set. For this, Space-Saving uses an heuristic they call _the benefit of the
doubt_: if the stream contains an item not in the top `m`, then it is given the
benefit of the doubt, and replaces the rarest item in the top `m`. [The
paper](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/research/tech-reports/2005-23) works through the
consequences of this assumption for error rates, and demonstrates on real data
that the algorithm is fast enough to be both updated and queried with live
data. In fact, as CloudFlare [revealed in a recent
talk](https://www.dotconferences.com/2015/06/john-graham-cumming-i-got-10-trillion-problems-but-logging-aint-one),
Space-Saving is, in fact, the algorithm they use to deal with their ten
_trillion_ monthly clicks.

Probabilistic algorithms and data structures such as Space-Saving and Cuckoo
Filters (which we wrote about [on our
blog](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/11/23/probabilistic-data-structure-showdown-cuckoo.html))
exist at the intersection of statistics and computer science. Machine
learning's hunger for training data has made these algorithms more valuable. At
the same time, fundamental algorithmic innovations like Space-Saving have
driven progress in the application of machine learning at internet scale. We're
looking forward to seeing what the future brings.

Our clients have access to [FF02: _Probabilistic Methods for
Realtime Streams_](https://clients.fastforwardlabs.com/ff02/report), which
covers this field and its applications in more detail. We'd love to discuss any
challenges you have along these lines.

## Small change, big impact
_by [Nisha](https://twitter.com/NishaMuktewar)_

In the midst of growing concern over AI (be it in the form of erosion of privacy, threats to democracy, automation effects 
on unemployment, etc.), one can no longer assume that the computing research community can have a net positive impact on 
the world. Take for instance, the recent [RadioLab interview](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/breaking-news) about research 
on generative visual and audio models and their powerful anti-social applications. There is clearly a gap in the way 
researchers view their work and the way it impacts society. A recent [interview](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05791-w) in Nature(https://www.nature.com/) with [Dr. Brent Hecht](http://www.brenthecht.com/), a computer scientist who chairs the [ACM Future of Computing Academy](https://acm-fca.org/) (FCA), talks about a controversial proposal to address these downsides to innovations. 

The (FCA) proposes that the computer-science community should change its peer-review process to ensure that researchers disclose any possible negative societal consequences of their work in papers, or risk rejection. Just like a paper submitted for a conference or journal is evaluated for its intellectual rigor, the idea is to also identify the expected side effects or unintended uses of the technology.

This raises two critical questions:   

**What if a research project does more harm than good?** In that case, one of the FCA's recommendations for the authors would be to discuss complementary technologies, policies, or other interventions that could mitigate the negative broader impacts of the paper or proposal. In most cases, this approach will help researchers outline a path by which their work can have an overall positive effect. It could potentially also result in additional benefits - in particular, increased formal and public support from the computing community for policies that can mitigate computingâ€™s negative impact. 

**What about non-scholarly research (aka private technology companies who do research)?** This is where they would encourage 
the technology press to come in and act as gatekeepers. It would again mean asking the researchers and the firms that they
represent to enumerate the downsides of their products or services. It would also mean asking them to discuss what changes to their technologies and what new policies might mitigate these downsides.

Action on these recommendations would lead to many desirable outcomes, be it in the form of increased intellectual rigor, more 
support for key govermental policies, greater societal benefits, or - most importantly - greater engagement with social scientists who have a great deal of expertise in understanding the societal impacts of diverse types of interventions. 

That said, implementing these recommendations would also raise a number of questions and challenges. For instance, authors of papers may be concerned that it is difficult to predict and think through all of the potential use cases of the technology; they may never be 100% certain that they have stated them all.  There could also be potential disagreements between the authors and reviewers - but all this, at the very least, is a step in the right direction. As Dr. Brent Hecht mentions in his interview, it is a hard problem to solve; the researchers might miss tonnes of negative impacts, but even if we were to catch just 1% or 5%, it would be worth it.
