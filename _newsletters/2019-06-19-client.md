## Recommended Reading

We are hard at work wrapping up our next report (coming soon!) and choosing a topic for the one to follow, so in lieu of a newsletter article this week, here is some alternative reading we'd recommend!

---

### [Gary Marcus - Deep Learning: A Critical Appraisal (pdf)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00631.pdf)


*I've been re-reading this; I'm interested in digging in more around the boundaries of deep learning and thinking about what the next few years will look like in machine learning research. - [Alice](https://twitter.com/AliceAlbrecht)*

### [The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635)
*This paper introduces the idea of finding subnetworks of a larger neural network that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. - [Victor](https://twitter.com/vykthur)*

### [Stabilizing the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (pdf)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01611.pdf)
*After I read the paper Victor mentioned, I read this, which expands the ideas explored in the other paper beyond network initialization by introducing the concepts of rewinding and stability to enable pruning of large-scale networks--not just small benchmarks. - [Justin](https://twitter.com/JustinJDN)*

### [How to Do Nothing - by Jenny Odell](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/9781612197494/)
*A thoughtful look at how to deal with a productivity-obsessed world. This book went in a lot of directions I wasn’t expecting and gave me a lot to think about (also lots of references to great art to look into). If you want a preview, you can read the [transcript of the talk the book is based on](https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb). - [Grant](https://twitter.com/GrantCuster)*

### [Neural Approaches to Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08267.pdf)
*A comprehensive survey paper that discusses various neural approaches to conversational AI  (social chatbots, question answering and task completion) that have been developed in the last few years, the progress made and challenges
that still exist. In addition, gives a brief review of several conversational systems in industry and a discussion of research trends. - [Nisha](https://twitter.com/NishaMuktewar)*

### [Radford Neal’s PhD thesis: Bayesian Learning for Neural Networks (1995) (pdf)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.446.9306&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

*Ok, ok, I admit I’m not even nearly through the whole thing yet, but the introduction alone is a study in lucid technical writing. Exciting things happen when we combine principled Bayesian reasoning with the flexible function approximation capabilities of neural networks, and this is a foundational text for that intersection. - [Chris](https://twitter.com/_cjwallace)*
