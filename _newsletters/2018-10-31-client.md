## Federated Learning: Machine Learning with Privacy on the Edge

Federated Learning is a technology that allows you to build machine learning systems when your datacenter can’t get direct access to model training data. The data remains in its original location, which helps to ensure privacy and reduces communication costs.

Privacy and reduced communication makes federated learning a great fit for smartphones and edge hardware, healthcare and other privacy-sensitive use cases, and industrial applications such as predictive maintenance...

## Why Every Data Scientist Should Play a Product Manager on TV

_by [Justin](https://twitter.com/JustinJDN?lang=en)_

The dreams (and nightmares) of a world driven by machine learning and AI (ML/AI) continue to captivate us all.  As industries and governments progress through the age of [AI Industrialization](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloudera-unveils-vision-for-industrialization-of-ai-at-gartner-symposium-itxpo-300732514.html), it is clear that there is still much work to be done to create the 'digital infrastructure' necessary to scale and maintain ML/AI platforms, tools and applications.  Moreover, only a few companies have managed to build sustainable ML/AI-driven businesses, a sort of machine learning 'nirvana,' where these capabilities are woven into the very DNA of the organization. The majority are still somewhere on the adoption curve.  For years now, brillant people in these firms have been tasked with applying advanced probablistic techniques in order to solve previously impossible problems.  So why is so much of the promise of the ML/AI-driven future still left unrealized?  One factor is often a lack of alignment between product development and data science.       

In 2014, Ram Sangireddy [wrote](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141114214833-28715035-data-science-is-about-discovery-product-management-is-about-innovation/), "Data Science is about Discovery, Product Management is about Innovation."  Practitioners in these roles may often be driven by factors that naturally align them to these categories (precision for data scientists and customer-driven strategic planning for product managers).  However, this natural - even organic - alignment isn't always what's best for a machine learning product or even ultimately for the business.

In reality, in today's ultra-competitive market, it is the organizations that can cultivate and support ML/AI-driven product managers and product-focused data scientists that will be able to not only recognize opportunities in the ML/AI space, but have the ability to design, develop, and deliver amazing products that capitalize for their companies.  

Much has been [written](https://hackernoon.com/machine-learning-for-product-managers-ba9cf8724e57) about why product managers need an understanding of machine learning to be effective today, but less has been writeen on why data science practitioners need to be more product-oriented.  As game-changing as data scientists can be, many have a tendancy to apply a laser focus to the machine learning components of a given problem -- specifically, how a model (or pipeline of models) can be developed to predict or classify a desired target value or outcome.  But excellence in this capability (though critical), is far from a silver bullet.  

Just like more traditional software products before them, machine learning products need to solve a novel problem that is actually important to the business.  To deliver that solution, models also need a stable platform to launch and run on, flexible and continous integration and development processes to help them improve, monitoring and alerting services to track problems, and an awesome interface - so that humans can actually capture value from what the models can do.  Achieving these goals may sound like a lot more work than just training excellent models -- and it is!  

The good news is that software product management is a relatively mature field, so some of the practices can be adopted to support data scientists as they build our ML/AI products.  Brendan Freehart shares some of these in his [post](https://www.usermuse.com/blog/good-data-scientist-think-like-product-team/) about leading a data science/product management double life.  Other tools and techniques that may be needed (like how to best manage experiments) are not as easily applied and so somewhat bespoke solutions are needed.  

At [Cloudera Fast Forward Labs](https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research.html), we take a product-first approach to building ML/AI applications and specialize in helping other teams build this capability into their own organizations, while keeping in mind the reasons why most of us started this journey in the first place: to utilize the power of ML and AI to build a better version of the future.

## Recommended Reading

Here are a few articles we found interesting this week:

* [How to Decide Which Data Science Projects to Pursue](https://hbr.org/2018/10/how-to-decide-which-data-science-projects-to-pursue) - from our very own [Hilary Mason](https://twitter.com/hmason)
* [Parsing logs 230x faster with Rust](https://andre.arko.net/2018/10/25/parsing-logs-230x-faster-with-rust/) - a fun production story about speeding up a daily analysis job by porting the code to rust and deploying on serverless. The punchline is not only the 230x speedup, but also the fact that the cost goes from hundreds of dollars per month to essentially zero.
* [On teaching ethics to tech companies](http://blog.geomblog.org/2018/10/on-teaching-ethics-to-tech-companies.html) - Suresh Venkatasubramanian argues for _regulation_ of tech, rather than ethics education.
* [Automatically playing science communication games with transfer learning and fastai](https://simonwillison.net/2018/Oct/29/transfer-learning/) - "Cougar or Not": a clear, well-documented example of transfer learning for image recognition — and subsequent production deployment — in this case, using images from iNaturalist, a citizen science social network. (This is not a million miles away from the kind of thing we do for our research prototypes, and we're always glad to get into training and production details with clients!)
