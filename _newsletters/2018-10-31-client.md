## Recommended Reading

Here are a few articles we found interesting this week:

* [Parsing logs 230x faster with Rust](https://andre.arko.net/2018/10/25/parsing-logs-230x-faster-with-rust/) - a fun production story about speeding up a daily analysis job by porting the code to rust and deploying on serverless. The punchline is not only the 230x speedup, but also the fact that the cost goes from hundreds of dollars per month to essentially zero.
* [On teaching ethics to tech companies](http://blog.geomblog.org/2018/10/on-teaching-ethics-to-tech-companies.html) - Suresh Venkatasubramanian argues for _regulation_ of tech, rather than ethics education.
[Automatically playing science communication games with transfer learning and fastai](https://simonwillison.net/2018/Oct/29/transfer-learning/) - "Cougar or Not": a clear, well-documented example of transfer learning for image recognition — and subsequent production deployment — in this case, using images from iNaturalist, a citizen science social network. (This is not a million miles away from the kind of thing we do for our research prototypes, and we're always glad to get into training and production details with clients!)
