## Is Applied Machine Intelligence Work Stratifying?

For those who work in data science and machine intelligence, there has never 
been a single, stable job description that covers the entire range of skills 
and forms of expertise that the work actually entails. Depending on the job, 
there can be a rather large contrast between the skills that are regularly 
drawn upon and the responsibilities of employees to perform 
research, interface with clients, build and deploy products, maintain 
systems, and innovate their practices. Despite - or perhaps because of - the 
wide gamut of roles that fall under the heading of 'data scientist,' there have been a slew
of thoughtful articles published in recent weeks about the changing 
landscape of this kind of work.
 
One article squarely addresses the range of demands placed on data scientists
working in industry. Writing for [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/why-businesses-fail-at-machine-learning-fbff41c4d5db), Cassie Kozyrkov 
suggests that there are "two machine learnings," one centered on researching 
advances in the algorithms that power machine learning capabilities, and one 
centered on building things for business that utilize these capabilites. Her 
analogy to the world of baking is not inapt: there are folks building better 
ovens and folks baking better biscuits, and the folks baking biscuits don't 
need to know how to build an oven. We generally agree that being able to 
recreate a formal proof of the mathematics of backpropagation is not a 
prerequisite for implementing a neural network, but the difference between 
these skills is not as clear cut as it might seem. Bakers need to know how 
ovens work in intimate detail in order to be the best bakers they can be: 
understanding thermodynamics and how they play in to various oven 
designs helps in choosing which oven to buy, how to adjust its settings, and 
even how to forecast its maintenance costs over its lifetime. So, while you 
don't necessarily _need_ to hire an academic AI researcher to build you a 
custom algorithm, you _do_ need a team that is adept at fitting business 
problems, available data, and tools together in a way that achieves a 
meaningful result. Without knowing how algorithms work, it's difficult to put everything together properly.

On the other hand, there are two emerging trends in machine intelligence that
seem to run counter to the advice given above. One is the rise of code-free 
deep learning, which Baidu is rapidly developing and deploying under the 
moniker [EasyDL](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/baidu-no-code-easydl-tool-could-democratize-ai-for-small-businesses-bridge-talent-gap/). With code-free machine learning platforms, 
non-programmers can train, test, and deploy classifiers without much more than 
labelled data sets and a well-posed problem. This looks like an early example 
of another emerging theme that some are calling [Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35), which shifts the 
emphasis of software design from coding "explicit instructions" towards 
mapping inputs to desired outputs by learning that mapping with, for 
example, a neural network. Beyond setting up a neural network architecture, 
then, Software 2.0 relies mostly on thoughtful curation of the training data 
that provide examples of those desired results, which isn't all that 
different from the code-free deep learning of EasyDL.

Our take-away from the 
conversation is that one of the most important skills in applied machine 
intelligence will continue to be the ability to properly frame problems. 
Being able to properly abstract a real-world problem to one that can be 
solved by machine intelligence is the key to good work now, and will likely 
continue to be the case in the near future. Without a good abstraction of a 
problem, choosing datasets, algorithmic approaches, and even hardware is 
difficult - but it can be done by building domain knowledge into models, careful feature engineering, and a clear articulation of what 'success' looks like for any given project.
