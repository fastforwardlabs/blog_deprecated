## Radiologists post - add this to the end


For a thorough examination of how radiologists work, not just in using their expertise to read films, but to ally with techs and other diagnostic specialists, care for patients, and function within the hospital setting, "[CT Suite: The Work of Diagnosis in the Age of Noninvasive Cutting](https://www.dukeupress.edu/ct-suite)" by Barry F. Saunders is a fascinating read that addresses the history of radiology, the epistemology of diagnosis, and the work of medicine in ways that offer valuable insights for anyone building medical technology. (NOTE: let's save this last paragraph and include the whole piece in the public newsletter with it, but for this client newsletter, let's take it out (it's interesting, but this section is a little lengthy, and we need to shorten it). Could you add a sentence to the end of the previous paragraph instead, relating the conversation in radiology to jobs/tech in all sectors?)
