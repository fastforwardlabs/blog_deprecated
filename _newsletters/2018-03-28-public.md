## Unemployment vs. Augmentation

In the ongoing debates around whether or not robots are going to take our jobs, listening to those who have a real stake in the technology is critical, and often offers important insights for how we build new technologies, as well as how we talk about what we build. Take, for example, this [blog post](https://becominghuman.ai/radiologists-as-knowledge-experts-in-a-world-of-artificial-intelligence-summary-of-radiology-ec63a7002329) by Judy Gichoya about the Radiology Society of North America's annual meeting last December, which provides a useful window into the concerns radiologists have about the ways automation will affect their profession, and how those concerns could be taken into account when building capabilities that impact their domain of expertise. Radiologists are justified in seeing their jobs as directly within the sights of automation, even if the tech is not there yet. (Kaggle's [Data Science Bowl 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017) offered a $1 million prize for submissions that could best detect lung cancer from CT scans, a problem that is squarely within the existing job function of radiologists around the world.)  But although the risk is real, the idea that any algorithm will replace all radiologists overnight can be easily dismissed. There is more to radiology than just reading film, questions of liability and responsibility are far from being solved, and image classification tools are not nearly accurate or generalizable enough yet for wide scale deployment.

That said, let's look at how radiologists are talking about the impact of AI on their occupations for some important insights. The first of these is that zero-sum framing doesn't help anyone. The blog author points to a Stanford [press release](https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2017/11/15/algorithm-outpernosing-pneumonia/) that celebrates their researchers' algorithm that "can diagnose pneumonia better than radiologists." The adversarial framing of the release is problematic, and not just because the Stanford algorithm had to be tested against radiologist-assigned labels (for a more thorough discussion of the testing and performance comparison methodology, see the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05225)). Posing the issue as a man vs. machine problem forecloses a more worthwhile discussion on how image classification can be used to **aid** radiologists in their work, making them more efficient, accurate, and valuable in the roles they currently hold. This is a point developers could be making from the outset, rather than defaulting to a triumphalist tone of voice, stating that the latest algorithm has defeated humans once and for all.

Collaborations between domain experts and developers can be built into the very earliest stages of a project. Radiologists know their workflows, what hard problems pertain to their field, where advances are needed, and where automation can help (rather than displace) their expertise. The same principle applies to other roles and industries as well, and this conversation among radiologists illustrates how people in general can respond to advances in AI that affect their domains. Radiologists are already planning how to be useful to the development of AI technology; developers can certainly welcome them to the conversation, and we hope the same will happen across the board.

For a thorough examination of how radiologists work, not just in using their expertise to read films, but to ally with techs and other diagnostic specialists, care for patients, and function within the hospital setting, "[CT Suite: The Work of Diagnosis in the Age of Noninvasive Cutting](https://www.dukeupress.edu/ct-suite)" by Barry F. Saunders is a fascinating read that addresses the history of radiology, the epistemology of diagnosis, and the work of medicine in ways that offer valuable insights for anyone building medical technology.

## New creative possibilities with machine learning

Machine learning techniques are able to organize large amounts of unstructured data. Combined with dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE, this capability opens up new ways for us to interact with creative material including sounds, words, and ideas. In this section we highlight three of our favorite recent experiments.

![A screenshot of The Infinite Drum Machine. Showing the sample map with certain sounds like "Bag Plastic" highlighted and a drum sequencer at the bottom.]({{ site.github.url }}/images/editor_uploads/2018-03-09-203445-Screen_Shot_2018_03_08_at_3_21_16_PM.png)

[The Infinite Drum Machine](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai/drum-machine) is a Google Creative Lab experiment by Manny Tan and Kyle McDonald. It uses machine learning to cluster a large number of samples by similarity of sound. The user then selects clips, which can range from "gravel scoop tin cup" to "casino poker chip," from a sound map visualization created using t-SNE. The samples feed into a sequencer to create an uncanny drum machine.

Conceptually, the project works because it plays off the long history of hip-hop and electronic musicians using samples from surprising sources (one of Grant's favorite, kind of gross, examples is [Matmos' "A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure"](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5151-a-chance-to-cut-is-a-chance-to-cure/)). Sometimes machine learning systems give disappointing results because the system lacks context. In this case, the lack of context is a virtue. It frees the system up to make connections between sounds that humans, with their knowledge of each sound's source, might never make. It reminds us of first learning to draw, where you have to let go of your idea of what an apple looks like and draw the apple exactly as it appears in front of you.

Samples map well because each sound has a quantifiable (wave) form. Anything involving words gets more complicated. Do you compare on similarity of phoneme, grapheme, or meaning?

![A screenshot of an example from "Voyages in Sentence Space." It shows this example: 
"I went looking for adventure. I went out on a mission. I shouted awkwardly. I stared incredulously. I feel desperate. I never returned. I never returned."]({{ site.github.url }}/images/editor_uploads/2018-03-09-211736-Screen_Shot_2018_03_08_at_3_52_58_PM.png)

In [Voyages in Sentence Space](https://www.robinsloan.com/voyages-in-sentence-space/), Robin Sloan uses machine learning to explore the possibility space between sentences, which he calls "sentence gradients" (we love that metaphor). Instead of showing the whole map, it focuses on a specific journey from one sentence to another. As for how it does comparisons, Robin [tweeted about one illustrative example](https://twitter.com/robinsloan/status/969386860190433281) where, according to the model, '"thousand" is more like "three" than it is like "hundred" because of the "th."'

![A screenshot of Encartopedia. On the left is the Wikipedia article on Euclid. On the right is a visualization of the articles on Wikipedia and a line showing the user's journey through other articles to get to the Euclid article.]({{ site.github.url }}/images/editor_uploads/2018-03-09-213600-Screen_Shot_2018_03_08_at_4_32_10_PM.png)

[Sepand Ansari's](https://sepans.com/) [Encartopedia](http://encartopedia.fastforwardlabs.com/#/), which he made while working with us here at CFFL, looks at visualizing Wikipedia articles as an idea map, and plotting the user's journey through that space. It suggests how new capabilities can help us reflect on our thought process, by showing us how we move through an idea space.

## Recommended Reading

We love to read; here are a few of our more interesting finds this month. Of particular interest, in light of our [recent report](https://www.fastforwardlabs.com/research/FF07):

[Listing Embeddings for Similar Listing Recommendations and Real-time Personalization in Search](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/listing-embeddings-for-similar-listing-recommendations-and-real-time-personalization-in-search-601172f7603e)

Airbnb gives a rich account of how they have made use of embeddings for their recommendation systems. Embeddings are major part of semantic recommendation systems, which offer a solution to the cold start problem endemic to collaborative filtering recommenders. Collaborative filtering recommenders make recommendations (between books and customers, for example) by looking at other shoppers with similar purchasing histories, and then recommending books from other customers' histories to a potential buyer. The intuition behind collaborative filtering is that if you like some of the same things other people like, you'll also like the other things those people like. But what if no one has bought a book yet, because it's a new release? How do you know who to recommend it to? Wouldn't it be great if you could take its genre, style, and plot into account and base your recommendation off of those qualities? 

Semantic recommendations are able to do just that, by taking those qualities and embedding them in multi-dimensional representations of (for example) a book, song, or apartment rental. Airbnb uses embeddings to populate their carousel of recommendations to users with alternate listings that match not only the size, price, and location of a listing a user clicked on, but also match stylistic features like decor, architectural type, and amenities. The article discusses how they evaluated the effectiveness of this approach for improving their personalized recommendation system, and how they deployed it to work in real time.
