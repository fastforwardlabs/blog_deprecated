Hello!  In keeping with our reputation as your data nerd best friends, here are our (eclectic) recommendations for some great reading this month:

---

#### [ML beyond Curve Fitting: An Intro to Causal Inference and the do-Calculus](https://www.inference.vc/untitled/) 
I worked through this article in detail, taking notes, and left convinced that causal inference is a useful and practical framework for thinking about problems. It also helped me understand where Judea Pearl’s do-calculus fits in the broader ML picture. I certainly have details to fill in with more reading, but I substantially enhanced my reasoning toolbox by reading this article alone. Very highly recommended. - *[Chris](https://twitter.com/_cjwallace)*

#### [Evading Real-Time Person Detectors by Adversarial T-shirt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11099) 
A fun read! Instead of holding a cardboard with an adversarial patch, we can now wear a T-shirt and go undetected. It's a physical adversarial wearable! - *[Shioulin](https://twitter.com/shioulin_sam)*

#### [Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html)
A long read with interesting insights. This paper introduces a framework for applying CD methods to machine learning applications. - *[Keita](https://twitter.com/keitabr)*

#### [Auptimizer - an Extensible, Open-Source Framework for Hyperparameter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02522) 
Great overview highlighting the difficulties of training hyperparameters for production ML. Their solution provides data scientists more flexibility, usability, scalability and extensibility in training production ML while also addressing reproducibility - crucial to successful implementation. - *[Melanie]( )

#### [Museum of the Future: The building designed by an algorithm](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191028-museum-of-the-future-the-building-designed-by-an-algorithm)
A fascinating and insightful read, highlighting the ways technology and an eye towards sustainability are changing the future of architecture.  [The Museum of the Future](http://www.museumofthefuture.ae/), scheduled to open in Dubai next fall, aims to be a cultural center of creativity and hope. I'm definitely adding a visit to my bucket list! - *[Danielle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellethorp/)*

[Twitter thread: programming book recommendations](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1190762799338790913) - A thread of responses to Dan Abramov’s (React.js developer) request for books on programming at a conceptual level. So far I’ve been enjoying [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201) and saved a bunch more of the suggestions to check out later. - *[Grant](https://twitter.com/GrantCuster)*
