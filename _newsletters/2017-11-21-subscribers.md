Welcome to our special Thanksgiving newsletter!

While you are planning your Thanksgiving meal, a robotic arm is holding the spoon at the Institute for Culinary Education (ICE). Progress is relentless; *"the Chef Watson cookbook is a revolutionary display of the creative collaboration of man and machine."* [Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson](https://www.ice.edu/about-us/brand-at-ice/ibm-cognitive-cooking-with-chef-watson-partnership), culinary and *cognitive* creativity [at your fingertips](https://www.ibmchefwatson.com/community); perhaps you could try the Acorn Squash Meat Roast ... with English Breakfast Tea.

Jeopardy! It is [so 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)). In 2017, there is (of course) [a neural network trained to generate recipes](https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/neural-network-recipe-generator/). Try the *Pears Or To Garnestmeam* or the *Shanked Whipping Peanuts*:

For the literary-minded, we recommend training the neural network first on the works of your favorite author before feeding it recipes. Here is what happens when you use the works of H. P. Lovecraft:

> Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 32 minutes. Test corners to see if done, as center will seem like the next horror of Second House.
> 
> Whip Â½ pint of heavy cream. Add 4 Tbsp. brandy or rum to possibly open things that will never be wholly reported.

The algorithm adds a helpful note:

> NOTE:  As this is a tart rather than a cheesecake, you should be disturbed.

Indeed.

Eager to cook your own recipes with char-RNNs? The code is available [here](https://gist.github.com/nylki/1efbaa36635956d35bcc). Do androids dream of cooking electric pies? (We do have to ask.)

If you've got your ingredients already, take a quick picture and let [im2recipe](http://im2recipe.csail.mit.edu/) identify ingredients and serve you a recipe. In 2017, ["we can embed that"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03856) truly is the new ["we can pickle that."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYey8ntlK_E) (Pro-tip: challenge it with your left-overs.)

In the days after Thanksgiving, perhaps also try the algorithm for [personalized diet meal planning](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/11/algorithm-creates-diets-that-work-for-you/416583/) or [AVA](http://eatwithava.com/), an intelligent nutrition bot focused on your happiness.

(You're welcome!)

Finally, you will be pleased to know that the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) holds a yearly workshop with the appetizing title [*Multimedia for Cooking and Eating Activities*](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3106668&picked=prox&CFID=1003587697&CFTOKEN=19498186). We have high hopes for Thanksgiving 2018!

## Happy Thanksgiving from the Cloudera Fast Forward Labs Team

*"You realize that our mistrust of the future makes it hard to give up the past,"* said Chuck Palahniuk. Eleanore Roosevelt adds, *"the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."* 

This Thanksgiving at CFFL, Hilary is hopeful for a future in which machines reduce cognitive drudgery and *actually* help us spend more of our time on the parts of our lives that we enjoy. Brian is hopeful for data connecting people and saving lives (not just [smart salt dispensers called SMALT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2e1x5IaO7k)), while Ryan wishes for major tech companies to release their data for the greater good, regulatory policy that favors democracy over concentration of information and wealth, and more public datasets of puppy photos.

##### A view into the CFFL office with one of our two office dogs.

Grant hopes we see more focus on using advanced techniques to make machines better collaborators with humans rather than replacements for humans.  Danielle is hopeful for the impact and the beauty of new forms and styles of artistic expression enabled by AI/human collaboration through platforms like Google's [Deep Dream Generator](https://deepdreamgenerator.com/) and [Amper Music](https://www.ampermusic.com/). Mike is hopeful for technology providing a solution to traffic woes, whilst Friederike, putting aside technical challenges and societal concerns just for a hot second, imagines the aesthetic beauty in a world of self-driving and self-flying cars seamlessly coordinating their activities like one grand ballet performance in our city streets (and skies). Micha is hopeful for communities shaping algorithms in places where algorithms have been shaping communities. And Shioulin is thankful for her bouncy and gibberish 19 month old who puts all machine learning algorithms to shame and is a constant reminder of how much further the field has to go!
