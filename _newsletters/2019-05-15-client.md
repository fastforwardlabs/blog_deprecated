## Open-ended Text Generation
*by [Shioulin](https://twitter.com/shioulin_sam)*

The goal in open-ended text generation is to create a coherent portion of text that is
a continuation from the given context. For example, given a couple of sentences,
this capability makes it possible for machines to self-write a coherent
story. One can imagine using such a system for AI-assisted writing, but of
course it can also be repurposed to generate misleading (fake) news
articles. 

Ovid's Unicorn, written by [OpenAI's
GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), offers a glimpse of the
state-of-the art. Because it can generate astonishingly human-like passages, the
full GPT-2 model was not released initially (in Feb 2019) due to ethical
concerns. This decision resulted in a lively debate within the machine learning
community. (OpenAI has since decided (in May 2019) to use two mechanisms for
responsibly publishing GPT-2: staged release and partnership-based sharing.)

### How text generation works

To generate text, we typically use a language model along with a decoder. The
language model can be an LSTM, or something based on [the Transformer
architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), such as the GPT model. The
language model outputs the likelihood of each word in the vocabulary being the
_next word_ in the sequence. Ideally, the decoder then picks the _best sequence
of words_ that leads to the highest probability (likelihood) based on this
information. To do this, one has to search through all the possible sequences of
words - this computation is not tractable. As such, two approaches are used in
practice: greedy search and beam search.

In _greedy search_, the decoder picks the word that has the highest likelihood
of being the next word in the sequence. It only looks at the next word, and in
doing so, is only exploring one path to building a sequence of words.

A better approach is _beam search_. Rather than exploring a single path, beam
search keeps track of multiple paths. While beam search is effective for
non-open-ended generation tasks such as machine translation, data-to-text
generation, and summarization, it does not work well for open-ended text
generation.

### Why doesn't beam search work for open-ended text generation?

Using beam search as a decoder for open-ended generation results in text that is
strangely bland and repetitive. This is not because of "search error, where beam
search failed to find higher quality sentences to which the model assigns higher
probability than to the decoded ones." Rather, the [fundamental problem is the
maximum likelihood decoding objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751)

It turns out likelihood maximization approaches such as beam search tend to
produce sentences that loop repetitively. Further, the probability of forming a
loop (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know) increases with a longer loop -
once looping starts, it is difficult to get out of it. In addition, probability
distribution of human-generated text turns out to be very different from
machine-generated text. When using a maximum likelihood framework, the
machine-generated text is composed of tokens that are highly probable, but
human-generated text exhibits much richness and variance.

### Randomize!

Recently two approaches based on the idea of randomization have been shown to
work much better for open-ended generation. In [top-k
sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04833), the decoder randomly samples from
the top-k most likely next words. This is the approach used to generate Ovid's
Unicorn. Another approach is to ["select the highest probability tokens whose
cumulative probability mass exceeds a pre-chosen threshold](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751). In other words, instead of selecting k
tokens, we select n tokens where the summation of the probability from all n
tokens exceed a certain threshold, p. This results in a different number of
possible next words (vs _k_ fixed candidates) each time, and can be particularly
effective when we have a large number of words with almost equal
likelihoods. Using top-5, we would have just picked 5. The remaining (10 for
example) will have been left out, even though these words have similar
likelihood when compared to the top 5.

We are excited about the technical advances in open-ended text generation, but are
cautiously optimistic for these advances to be put to good use for safe and
ethical machine learning.
