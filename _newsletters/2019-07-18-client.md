## New research: Transfer Learning for Natural Language Processing
*by [Seth](https://twitter.com/shendrickson16)*

We are excited to announce that our new report on transfer learning for NLP will be releasing soon!  All around us we are seeing automated systems that are getting better and better at processing natural language. Machines that can work directly with natural language are powerful, especially as a human interface, because language is the most direct way in which we communicate. The potential impact of such systems is immense.

Learn more about the upcoming report [here](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/07/17/new-research-transfer-learning-for-natural-language-processing.html), and please join us for [our virtual event](https://www.cloudera.com/about/events/webinars/cffl-virtual-event-7-2019.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=ml&src=newsletter&cid=7012H000001l3VK&utm_content=FFL_Showcase_Organic_AMER_Webinar_2019-07-24) on Wednesday, July 24, 2019 at 1:00pm ET/10:00am PT.  We'll be showcasing *both* of our soon-to-be-released research reports - **Advances in Deep Learning for Image Analysis** and **Transfer Learning for Natural Language Processing**, as well as our new [experiments portal]((https://experiments.fastforwardlabs.com/))!  

You can register for the virtual event [here](https://www.cloudera.com/about/events/webinars/cffl-virtual-event-7-2019.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=ml&src=newsletter&cid=7012H000001l3VK&utm_content=FFL_Showcase_Organic_AMER_Webinar_2019-07-24).
